{"document": "He seems to have had the whip hand. Instead of doing that he entered into an arrangement which, while giving him the necessary facili- ties, appears to have satisfied the company by allowing it to retain its investments without a precipitate liquidation of a large portion thereof. It does not matter whether the company was right in this view or wrong, and in any event we are in no position to judge of the soundness of its decision because we have not all the materials before us. It has to be remembered that considerations of this kind go deeper than the apparent profit or loss on an isolated transaction standing by itself. \n It is not enough to say that the 50,000 shares which were cancelled earned in the following year only 31/2 per cent. interest as against 5 per cent. on the debentures because we do not know to what extent the hold- ings of the company would have been disturbed if this had not been done. What we do know is what the Income-tax Appel- late Tribunal has stated, namely, that-- the change brought about had been so designed that the investments of the company were not to be disturbed and as a consequence the income accrued was in no way to be affected. This has only to be stated to show the commercial nature of the transaction from the companys point of view. \n The High Court considered that the capital of the compa- ny could have been reduced in other ways. But that again is not the point. There are usually many ways in which a given thing can be brought about in business circles but it is not for the Court to decide which of them should have been employed when the Court is deciding a question under section 12(2) of the Income-tax Act. \nIt was argued on behalf of the respondent (basing the same on paragraph 7 of the appellants application to the High Court dated 5th April, 1947) that the company had at the time sufficient liquid resources to effect the reduction of capital desired and so it was not necessary to resort to this process. But that again is not the point. The company chose to do it this way, and as there was not even a sugges- tion of fraud, the only question is whether it was gone through as an ordinary commercial proposition. But we doubt if that is what paragraph 7 meant because in paragraph 4 of the application to the High Court dated 11th February, 1944, the petitioner stated that the money on hand and at short notice was only Rs. 8,94,379. That is a good deal short of 50 lacs. However, we need not enter into this in detail. On a full review of the facts it is clear that this transaction was voluntarily entered into in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of the business of the company and was made on the ground of commercial expediency. \n It therefore falls within the purview of section 12(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 before its amendment in 1939. This being an investment company, if it borrowed money and utilised the same for its investments on which it earned income, the interest paid by it on the loans will clearly be a permissible deduction under section 12(2) of the Income- tax Act. Whether the loan is taken on an overdraft, or is a fixed deposit or on a debenture makes no difference in law. The only argument urged against allowing this deduction to be made is that the person who took the debentures was the party who sold the ordinary shares. \n It cannot be disputed that if the debentures were held by a third party, the interest payable on the same would be an allowable deduction in calculating the total income of the assessee company. What difference does it make if the holder of the debentures is a shareholder ?", "summary": "On a full review of the facts it is clear that this transaction was voluntarily entered into in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of the business of the company and was made on the ground of commercial expediency. \n It therefore falls within the purview of section 12(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 before its amendment in 1939.

{"document": "The respondents at all material times were non-residents carrying on business at Secunderabad which was then in the territories of the Nizam of Hyderabad. They acted as agents for the supply of gas plants manufactured by Messrs. T. V. S. Iyengar Sons, Madura, to the Nizams Government, and also as agents of the Lucas Indian Services, Bombay branch, for the supply of certain goods to that Government. The year of assessment is 1945-46. There does not appear to have been any written agreement between the two manufacturers and the respondents but the goods were to be supplied on a commission basis. In pursuance of this agreement the respondents received from M s. T.V.S. lyengar Sons, Madura, cheques drawn on the Imperial Bank of India, Madras, amounting to Rs. 35,202 in respect of all goods supplied from -Madura and also from Lucas Indian Services, Bombay, by cheques drawn on Imperial Bank of India, Bombay branch, amounting to Rs. 5,302 in respect of goods supplied by them, thus making a total of Rs. 40,504. These cheques were sent by post and when received by the respondents at Secunderabad were credited in the account books of the respondents and sent to their banker G. Raghunathmal for collecting and crediting to the account of the respondents. As against these sums so deposited the respondents at once drew cheques and thus operated on these amounts deposited. In regard to the commission received from the Bombay firm it was paid into the account on December 22, 1944, but was given credit for only on January 2, 1945. The Income-tax Officer assessed these sums as taxable income holding that the entire amount of Rs. 40,504 was received in British India and not at Secunderabad. An appeal was taken by the respondents to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who upheld the order holding that income must be held to have accrued, arisen or received in British India.\n Against this order the respondents took an appeal to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and it was held that the amounts were received by the respondents from Madura and Bombay firms as commission but they were received at Secunderabad. The appeal was therefore allowed. The finding Of the Appellate Tribunal in their own words was- The contention of the Appellants is that the cheques being negotiable instruments and the creditor having accepted them and passed through their books, II the receipt must be taken to be receipts in Hyderabad. We agree with the view submitted by the appellants.\nIt was further contended that in this case there was an express agreement that the payment was to be made at Secunderabad and therefore the matter does not fall within the rule in Ogale Glass Works case (1) and the following principle laid down in judgment by Das, J. (as he then was), is inapplicable - Applying the above principles to the facts found by the Tribunal the position appears to be this. The engagement of the Government was to make payment by cheques. The cheques were drawn in Delhi and received by the assessee in Aundh by post.", "summary": "We agree with the view submitted by the appellants.\nApplying the above principles to the facts found by the Tribunal the position appears to be this.

{"document": "he appellant is the U. P. Electric Supply Co. Ltd., Lucknow, (hereinafter called the company). It appears that the company used to employ Messrs. s M. Choudhary (hereinafter referred to as the contractors) as its contractors for doing certain work for it. The contractors in their turn used to employ a number of persons to carry out the work which they had taken on contract. A dispute arose between the contractors and their workmen in 1956 and an application was made on June 6, 1956, by the workmen before the conciliation board.\nThe tribunal went into the evidence in this connection and came to the conclusion that these workmen were in fact and in reality the employees of the company. The main contention on behalf of the company before us is that even assuming that the Government had power under s. 5 read with cl. 12 of G. O. No. U-464 (LL)XXXVI-B- 257(LL)/1954, dated July 14, 1954, to implied the company as a party, the main issue decided by the tribunal was not referred to it and the tribunal could only decide the three matters of dispute included in the order of reference of July 31, 1956. Therefore, in so far as the tribunal went beyond the, three matters of dispute specified in the reference and decided the question whether the workmen concerned were in the employ of the company or of the contractors it was acting without jurisdiction as this matter was never referred to it. We are of opinion that this contention must prevail. As we have already pointed out, there were four matters before the conciliation board including the question of non-abolition of the contract system. Further before the conciliation board not only the contractors but the company was also a party, for obviously the question of non-abolition of the contract system would necessitate the presence of the company as a party to the proceedings.\n When however the Government referred the dispute to the tribunal on July 31, it did not include the fourth item which was before the conciliation board relating to the non-abolition of the contract system among the matters in dispute. It also did not include the company as one of the parties to the dispute, for the reference-order refers only to two parties to the dispute, namely, the contractors and their workmen. On such a reference there could be no jurisdiction in the tribunal to decide the question whether these workmen were the workmen of the company or of the contractors, for such a question was not referred to the tribunal. It is true that on August 13, 1956, the company was impleaded as a party to the dispute referred by the notification of July 31 but the matters in dispute remained unmended, and the question of non-abolition of the contract system or the question whether these workmen were the employees of the company in fact and in reality was not included in the matters of dispute by amendment under the proviso to s. 4 of the Act.", "summary": "The main contention on behalf of the company before us is that even assuming that the Government had power under s. 5 read with cl. 12 of G.

{"document": "This is an appeal by special leave against the order made on the 20th November, 1951, by the Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh in proceedings instituted by the respondents under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. There is no substantial dispute as to the facts leading up to the present appeal. The appellants were tenants of a certain shop premises situate in Solan Bazar in the district of Mahasu in Himachal Pradesh. On the llth October, 1947, they had executed a rent deed by which they agreed to pay an annual rent of Rs. 175 payable as to Rs. 50 on the last of Baisakh and as to the balance of Rs. 125 in the month of October, in default of which payment, the respondents, as landlords, would be entitled to recover the whole of the said rent in one lump sum.\nHe accordingly set aside the orders of the courts below and allowed the application for ejectment but gave the appelants three months time for vacating the premises. The appellants have now come up before this court on appeal by special leave obtained from this court. Learned advocate appearing in support of this appeal urges that the learned Judicial Commissioner acted wholly without jurisdiction inasmuch as (1) the Rent Controller or the District Judge exercising powers under the Act was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court and, therefore, article 227 confers no power on the court of the Judicial Commissioner over the Rent Controller or the District Judge, and (2) that article 227 read with article 241 confers no power of judicial superintendence on the court of the Judicial Commissioner. Re. l.-The court of the Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh exercises jurisdiction in relation to the whole of the territories of Himachal Pradesh. The Rent Controller and the District Judge exercising jurisdiction under the Act are certainly tribunals, if not courts, and they function within the territories of Himachal Pradesh. \n Therefore, article 297 (1) read with article 241 confers on the court of the Judicial Commissioner power of superintendence over such tribunals. The words in relation to which obviously qualify the word territories and not the words courts and tribunals. Re. 2.The material part of article 227 substantially reproduces the provisions of section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915, except that the power of superintendence has been extended by the article also to tribunals.\nIn this connection it has to be remembered that section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915, was reproduced in the Government of India Act, 1935, as section 224. Section 224 of the 1935 Act, however, introduced sub-section (2), which was new, providing that nothing in the section should be construed as giving the High Court any jurisdiction to,question any judgment of any inferior court which was not otherwise subject to appeal or revision. The idea presumably was to nullify the effect of the decisions of the different High Courts referred to above. Section 224 of the 1935 Act has been reproduced with certain modifications in article 227 of the Constitution.\nSukumar Mukherjee(2), to be exercised most sparingly and only in appropriate cases in order to keep the Subordinate Courts within the bounds of their authority and not for correcting mere errors.", "summary": "Learned advocate appearing in support of this appeal urges that the learned Judicial Commissioner acted wholly without jurisdiction inasmuch as (1) the Rent Controller or the District Judge exercising powers under the Act was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court and, therefore, article 227 confers no power on the court of the Judicial Commissioner over the Rent Controller or the District Judge, and (2) that article 227 read with article 241 confers no power of judicial superintendence on the court of the Judicial Commissioner.\nRe. l.-The court of the Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh exercises jurisdiction in relation to the whole of the territories of Himachal Pradesh.

The only question raised is as to the nature of the power of superintendence conferred by the article.

We are unable to accept this contention because clause ( 2) is, expressed to be without prejudice to the.generality of the provisions in clause (1)."}
{"document": "Special leave granted.\n Respondent 1 was suspended by order dated 28 7 1998 on the same day when disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him. He filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the order of suspension.\n By the impugned order the High Court noted that Respondent I had been empanelled for promotion to the post of Joint Commissioner on 28 5 1998 and the disciplinary proceedings commenced on 28 7 1998 and on the same day i.e 28 7 1998 he was suspended. From this the High Court concluded that the act of suspension was an after thought. Consequently the High Court directed that no effect should be given to the order of suspension and the select list for promotion should be given effect to forthwith.\n We are at a loss the understand as to how the High Court could pass such an order. Admittedly the disciplinary proceedings had commenced on 28 7 1998. Even if before that date the said respondent had been empanelled for promotion the Government cannot be prohibited from starting disciplinary proceedings if there are reasons for doing so. The High Court has not quashed the disciplinary proceedings and looking at the charges leveled against the respondent it cant of be said that there was any ulterior motive for the respondent being put under suspension. Furthermore where disciplinary proceedings are pending we are doubtful whether it was appropriate for the High Court to have directed that the select list for promotion should be given effect to forthwith especially when the High Court in the said order has permitted the disciplinary proceedings to continue. It is also difficult to appreciate the High Court holding that even though disciplinary proceedings could continue but no final order should be passed. No reasons for coming to this conclusion have been given.\n We therefore have no hesitation in set ting aside the impugned judgment of the High Court. The effect of this would be that Respondent 1 who was reinstated pursuant to an order passed by the High Court during the proceedings for contempt which are stated to have been initiated by the respondent would be placed under suspension forthwith till the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings or the withdrawal of the suspension order by the Government.", "summary": "Special leave granted\nWe are at a loss the understand as to how the High Court could pass such an order.\nIt is also difficult to appreciate the High Court holding that even though disciplinary proceedings could continue but no final order should be passed.\nWe therefore have no hesitation in set ting aside the impugned judgment of the High Court.\nThe effect of this would be that Respondent 1 who was reinstated pursuant to an order passed by the High Court during the proceedings for contempt which are stated to have been initiated by the respondent would be placed under suspension forthwith till the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings or the withdrawal of the suspension order by the Government."}
{"document": "An Industrial unit run by M s. Diamond Marbles Pvt. Ltd respondent No 4 was brought to sale in terms of Section 29 of the State Financial Corporation Act 1951 for short the State Act by Rajasthan Financial Corporation respondent No 3. Appellant before us participated in auction and its bid having been accepted took possession of the said unit on 28 8 1987 pursuant to the agreement entered into between them. On 4 12 1987 the Additional Collector of Central Excise adjudicated in a proceeding arising out of show cause notice issued under Section 11A of the Central Excise Act to respondent No 4 in relation to certain goods that are said to have been removed between 13 8 1986 and 23 8 1986 and excise duty of Rs 1 04 586.17 and penalty of Rs 3 lakhs was levied and demanded.\nNow taking the last contention first we may notice that this Court in Isha Marbles considered the scope of Section 24 of the Electricity Act and held that there is no charge over the property in question and when a premises comes to be owned or purchased by the auction purchaser he cannot be called upon to clear the past arrears when such purchaser seeks supply of electric energy or it is made clear in that decision that what matters is the contract entered into by the erstwhile consumer with the Board and the Board cannot seek the enforcement of contractual liability against the third party. Therefore this decision in Isha Marbles cannot be taken advantage of by the appellant at all in this case.\nIn this case the liability arises under the Central Excise Act and Rule 230 2 of the Central Excise Rules. The said Rule clearly indicates that it is a mode of recovery of the excise dues from the assets owned by a predecessor and on his liabilities being assessed could be recovered even from the successor.\nThe argument advanced by the appellant that sale having taken place under the State Act free of encumbrances and the transferor s rights or liabilities cannot be that of transferee does not hold good. Section 29 2 of the State Act makes it clear that the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to the Financial Corporation can be brought to sale and such a sale if resulted in transfer of property shall vest in the successor all rights in the property transferred as if the transfer has been made by the owner of the property. When sale made by the corporation is deemed to be a sale made by the owner of the property necessarily Rule 230 2 of the Central Excise Rules would be attracted.\nWe are not impressed with the argument that the State Act is a special enactment and the same would prevail over the Central Excise Act. Each of them is a special enactment and unless in the operation of the same any conflict arises this aspect need not be examined. In this case no such conflict arises between the corporation and the Excise Department.
