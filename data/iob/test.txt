This O
is O
a O
petition O
under O
article B-PROVISION
32 I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Constitution O
praying O
for O
the O
release O
of O
the O
peti- O
tioner O
from O
his O
alleged O
unlawful O
detention. O
We O
accepted O
the O
petition O
and, O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
hearing, O
ordered O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
to O
be O
released., O
We O
now O
proceed O
to O
give O
the O
reasons O
for O
our O
order. O
The O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
was O
arrested O
and O
detained O
under O
an O
order O
dated O
1st B-DATE
March, I-DATE
1950, O
made O
by O
the O
District O
Magistrate, O
Amritsar, O
under O
section3(1) O
of O
the O
Preventive B-STATUTE
Detention I-STATUTE
Act, I-STATUTE
1950 I-STATUTE
(hereinafter O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
Act O
) O
and O
the O
grounds O
of O
detention O
were O
communicated O
to O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
as O
required O
by O
section7 O
of O
the O
Act O
on O
15th B-DATE
March, I-DATE
1950. O
The O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
challenged O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
order O
on O
various O
grounds O
but, O
while O
the O
petition O
was O
pending O
after O
this O
Court O
issued O
a O
rule O
nisi O
to O
the O
respondent, O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
was O
served O
on O
6th O
August O
with O
another O
detention O
order O
dated O
30th O
July,1951 O
1, O
purporting O
to O
be O
made O
by O
the O
Governor O
of O
Punjab O
under O
sub-section(1) O
of O
section B-PROVISION
3 I-PROVISION
and O
section B-PROVISION
4 I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Act O
as O
amended O
by O
the O
Preventive O
Detention O
(Amendment) O
Act, O
1951, O
and O
he O
was O
served O
with O
fresh O
grounds O
of O
detention O
on O
16th B-DATE
August, I-DATE
1951. O
It O
will O
be O
seen O
that O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
order O
make O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
intended O
to O
operate O
as O
a O
fresh O
order O
for O
the O
detention O
of O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
and O
this O
view O
is O
strengthened O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
order O
was O
followed O
by O
the O
service O
of O
a O
fresh O
set O
of O
grounds O
on O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
as O
required O
by O
sec- O
tion O
7 O
of O
the O
Act O
a O
proceeding O
which O
would O
be O
wholly O
unnec- O
essary O
if O
no O
fresh O
order O
of O
detention O
was O
intended. O
Indeed, O
it O
was O
suggested O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
that O
the O
said O
order O
followed O
by O
service O
of O
fresh O
grounds O
only O
four O
days O
before O
the O
date O
fixed O
for O
the O
hearing O
of O
the O
petition O
by O
this O
Court O
was O
a O
deliberate O
move O
by O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
to O
cir- O
cumvent O
the O
objections O
raised O
by O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
to O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
earlier O
order O
of O
1st B-DATE
March, I-DATE
1950, O
and O
thus O
render O
the O
proceeding O
infructuous. O
However O
that O
may O
be, O
we O
are O
clearly O
of O
opinion O
that O
the O
order O
dated O
30th B-DATE
July, I-DATE
1951. O
must O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
fresh O
order O
made O
for O
the O
petitioners B-PETITIONER
detention O
in O
superession O
of O
the O
earlier O
order O
and O
the O
ques- O
tion O
is O
whether O
it O
was O
illegal O
in O
that O
it O
straightaway O
directed O
that O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
be O
detained O
till O
31st B-DATE
March, I-DATE
1952, O
which O
was O
the O
date O
of O
the O
expiry O
of O
the O
Act. O
Whatever O
might O
be O
the O
position O
under O
the O
Act O
before O
its O
amendment O
in O
February, O
1951, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
Act O
as O
amended O
requires O
that O
every.case O
of O
detention O
should O
be O
placed O
before O
an O
Advisory O
Board O
constituted O
under O
the O
Act O
(section O
9) I-PROVISION
and O
provides O
that O
if O
the O
Board O
reports O
that O
there O
is O
sufficient O
cause O
for O
the O
detention O
the O
appropriate O
Government O
may O
confirm O
the O
detention O
order O
and O
continue O
the O
detention O
of O
the O
person O
concerned O
for O
such O
period O
as O
it O
thinks O
fit O
(section O
11). O
It O
is, O
therefore, O
plain O
that O
it O
is O
only O
after O
the O
Advisory O
Board, O
to O
which O
the O
case O
has O
been O
referred, O
reports O
that O
the O
detention O
is O
justified, O
the O
Government O
should O
determine O
what O
the O
period O
of O
deten- O
tion O
should O
be O
and O
not O
before. O
The O
fixing O
of O
the O
period O
of O
detention O
in O
the O
initial O
order O
itself O
in O
the O
present O
case O
was, O
therefore, O
contrary O
to O
the O
scheme O
of O
the O
Act O
and O
cannot O
be O
supported. O
The O
learned O
Advocate-General, O
however, O
urged O
that O
in O
view O
of O
the O
provision O
in O
section B-PROVISION
11 I-PROVISION
(2) O
that O
if O
the O
Advisory O
Board O
reports O
that O
there O
is O
no O
sufficient O
cause O
for O
the O
detention, O
the O
person O
concerned O
would O
be O
released O
forth- O
with, O
the O
direction O
in O
the O
order O
dated O
30th B-DATE
July, I-DATE
1951, O
that O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
should O
be O
detained O
till O
31st B-DATE
March, I-DATE
1952, O
could O
be O
ignored O
as O
mere O
surplusage. O

It O
was O
not O
a O
case O
of O
an O
individual O
workers O
failure O
to O
turn O
up O
for O
work. O
It O
was O
a O
concerted O
action O
on O
the O
part O
of O
a O
large O
number O
of O
workers. O
The O
Appellate O
Tribunal O
was O
thus O
in O
error O
in O
not O
regarding O
it O
as O
a O
strike O
and O
it O
had O
no O
discretion O
not O
to O
regard O
what O
in O
law O
was O
a O
strike O
as O
not O
amounting O
to O
a O
strike. O
If O
it O
cannot O
be O
denied O
that O
the O
stoppage O
of O
work O
on O
1st B-DATE
November, I-DATE
1948, O
amounted O
to O
a O
strike, O
then O
it O
was O
certainly O
an O
illegal O
strike O
because O
no O
notice O
had O
been O
given O
to O
the O
management, O
the O
Mills O
being O
a O
public O
utility O
industry. O
It O
was O
contended O
by O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Union, O
who O
argued O
the O
case O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
workers, O
that O
the O
Factories B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
had O
no O
application O
to O
this O
case, O
because O
by O
a O
notification O
of O
the O
Government O
of O
Madras O
dated O
23rd B-DATE
August, I-DATE
1946, O
the O
Buckingham O
an O
Carnatic O
Mills O
had O
been O
exempted O
from O
the O
provisions O
of O
Chapter O
IV-A O
of O
the O
Act O
and O
the O
provisions O
of O
sections O
49-A O
and O
49-B O
were O
not O
therefore O
attracted O
to O
it O
and O
that O
no O
substantial O
question O
of O
law O
in O
respect O
to O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
section O
fell O
to O
be O
decided O
by O
this O
Court O
and O
that O
being O
so, O
this O
Court O
should O
not O
entertain O
this O
appeal O
under O
article B-PROVISION
136 I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Constitution. O
This O
contention O
has O
no O
validity. O
The O
Mills O
were O
granted O
exemption O
from O
the O
provisions O
of O
Chapter O
IV-A O
of O
the O
Factories B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
because O
their O
leave O
rules O
were O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
provisions O
of O
Chapter O
IV-A O
of O
the O
Factories B-STATUTE
Act. O
These O
rules O
being O
in O
similar O
terms, O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
matter O
depends O
on O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
rules O
and O
this O
in- O
volves O
a O
substantial O
question O
of O
law. O
Reliance O
was O
next O
placed O
on O
section B-PROVISION
49-A I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Factories B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
which O
provides O
that O
the O
provisions O
of O
the O
new O
Act O
would O
not O
operate O
to O
the O
prejudice O
of O
any O
rights O
which O
the O
workers O
were O
entitled O
to O
under O
the O
earlier O
rules O
and O
it O
was O
argued O
that O
under O
the O
leave O
rules O
of O
the O
Mills O
which O
prevailed O
prior O
to O
the O
coming O
into O
force O
of O
the O
Factories B-STATUTE
Act, I-STATUTE
the O
workers O
were O
entitled O
to O
privilege O
leave O
and O
there O
was O
no O
provision O
in O
those O
rules O
similar O
to O
the O
one O
that O
has O
been O
made O
in O
section B-PROVISION
49-B I-PROVISION
or O
in O
the O
new O
rules O
and O
that O
the O
Mills O
had O
no O
right O
to O
deprive O
them O
of O
leave O
by O
reason O
of O
the O
strike. O
This O
contention O
cannot O
be O
sustained O
because O
section B-PROVISION
49-A I-PROVISION
(2) O
of O
the O
Factories B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
has O
no O
application O
to O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Carnatic O
Mills O
in O
view O
of O
the O
notification O
dated O
23rd B-DATE
August, I-DATE
1946. O
Lastly, O
it O
was O
urged O
that O
the O
stoppage O
of O
work O
on O
1st B-DATE
November, I-DATE
1948, O
was O
not O
a O
concerted O
action O
-on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
workers O
and O
that O
several O
workers O
in O
their O
own O
individual O
capacity O
wanted O
leave O
on O
that O
date. O
In O
our O
opinion, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
facts O
and O
circumstances O
detailed O
in O
the O
adjudicators O
award O
this O
contention O
cannot O
be O
seriously O
considered. O
We O
concur O
in O
the O
view O
of O
the O
facts O
taken O
by O
the O
adjudicator O
that O
the O
action O
of O
the O
859 O
workers O
on O
the O
night O
of O
1st B-DATE
November, I-DATE
1948, O
fell O
within O
the O
definition O
of O
the O
word O
strike O
as O
given O
in O
section B-PROVISION
2(q) I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Industrial B-STATUTE
Disputes I-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
and O
it O
was O
an O
illegal O
strike O
and O
the O
workers O
thus O
lost O
the O
benefit O
of O
holidays O
that O
they O
would O
have O
otherwise O
got O
under O
the O
rules. O
The O
learned O
counsel O
for O
the O
appellant O
undertook O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
management O
ex O
gratia O
that O
it O
would O
condone O
the O
default O
of O
the O
workers O
on O
1st B-DATE
November, I-DATE
1948, O
and O
the O
cessation O
of O
work O
on O
that O
night O
would O
not O
be O
treated O
as O
depriving O
them O
of O
the O
holidays O
under O
the O
rules O
and O
we O
appreciate O
-the O
spirit O
in O
which O
this O
undertaking O
was O
given O
and O
hope O
that O
the O
workers O
would O
also O
take O
it O
in O
that O
spirit. O

The O
learned O
Judges O
of O
the O
High O
Court O
have O
also O
very O
-rightly O
observed O
in O
their O
order O
under O
section B-PROVISION
476 I-PROVISION
that O
they O
were O
not O
expressing O
any O
opinion O
on O
the O
guilt O
or O
innocence O
of O
the O
appellants. O
We O
were O
informed O
at O
the O
hearing O
that O
two O
further O
sets O
of O
proceedings O
arising O
out O
of O
the O
same O
facts O
are O
now, O
pending O
against O
the O
appellants. O
One O
is O
two O
civil O
suits O
for O
damages O
for O
wrongful O
confinement. O
The O
other,is O
two O
criminal O
prosecutions O
under O
section B-PROVISION
344, O
Indian B-STATUTE
Penal I-STATUTE
Code, I-STATUTE
for O
wrongful O
confinement, O
one O
against O
each O
Sub-Inspector. O
It O
was O
said O
that O
the O
simultaneous O
prosecution O
of O
these, O
matters O
will O
embarrass O
the O
accused. O
But O
after O
the O
hearing O
of O
the O
appeal O
we O
received O
information O
that O
the O
two O
criminal O
prosecutions O
have O
been O
closed O
with O
liberty O
to O
file O
fresh O
complaints O
when O
the O
papers O
are O
ready, O
as O
the O
High O
Court O
records O
were O
not O
available O
on O
the O
application O
of O
the O
accused O
As O
these O
prosecutions O
are O
not O
pending O
at O
the O
moment, O
the O
objection O
regarding O
them O
does O
not O
arise O
but O
we O
can O
see O
that O
the O
simultaneous O
prosecution O
of O
the O
present O
criminal O
proceedings O
out O
of O
which O
this O
appeal O
arises O
and O
the O
civil O
suits O
will O
embarrass O
the O
accused. O
We O
have O
therefore O
to O
determine O
which O
should O
be O
stayed. O
As O
between O
the O
civil O
and O
the O
criminal O
proceedings O
we O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
criminal O
matters O
should O
1149 O
be O
given O
precedence. O
There O
is O
some O
difference O
of O
opinion O
in O
the O
High O
Courts O
of O
India O
on O
this O
point. O
No O
hard O
and O
fast O
rule O
ban. O
be O
laid O
down O
but O
we O
do O
not O
consider O
that O
the O
possibility O
of O
conflicting O
decisions O
in O
the O
civil O
and O
criminal O
courts O
is O
a O
relevant O
consideration. O
The O
law O
envisages O
such O
an O
eventuality O
when O
it O
expressly O
refrains O
from O
making O
the O
decision O
of O
one O
court O
binding O
on O
the O
other, O
or O
even O
relevant, O
except O
for O
certain O
limited O
purposes, O
such O
as O
sentence O
or O
damages. O
The O
only O
relevant O
consideration O
here O
is O
the O
likelihood O
of O
embarrassment. O
Another O
factor O
which O
weighs O
with O
us O
is O
that O
a O
civil O
suit O
often O
drags O
on O
for O
years O
and O
it O
is O
undesirable O
that O
a O
criminal O
prosecution O
should O
wait O
till O
everybody O
concerned O
has O
forgotten O
all O
about O
the O
crime. O
The O
public O
interests O
demand O
that O
criminal O
justice O
should O
be O
swift O
and O
sure O
that O
the O
guilty O
should O
be O
punished O
while O
the O
events O
are O
still O
fresh O
in O
the O
public O
mind O
and O
that O
the O
innocent O
should O
be O
absolved O
as O
early O
as O
is O
consistent O
with O
a O
fair O
and O
impartial O
trial. O
Another O
reason O
is O
that O
it O
is O
undesirable O
to O
let O
things O
glide O
till O
memories O
have O
grown O
too O
dim O
to O
trust. O
This,however, O
is O
not O
a O
hard O
and O
fast O
rule. O
Special O
considerations O
obtaining O
in O
any O
particular O
case O
might O
make O
some O
other O
course O
more O
expedient O
and O
just. O
For O
example, O
the O
civil O
case O
or O
the O
other O
criminal O
proceeding O
may O
be O
so O
hear O
its O
end O
as O
to O
make O
it O
inexpedient O
to O
stay O
it O
in O
order O
to O
give O
precedence O
to O
a O
prosecution O
order O
of O
under O
section B-PROVISION
476. O
But O
in O
this O
case O
we O
are O
of O
the O
view O
that O
the O
civil O
suits O
should O
be O
stayed O
till O
the O
criminal O
proceedings O
have O
finished. O

In O
this O
connection, O
it O
must O
be O
noted O
that O
while O
section B-PROVISION
41 I-PROVISION
of O
Act O
No. O
XLIII O
of O
1951 O
contains O
a O
prohibition O
against O
the O
appointment O
of O
certain O
persons O
as O
election O
agents, O
there O
is O
none O
such O
with, O
reference O
to O
the O
appointment O
of O
polling O
agents O
under O
section B-PROVISION
46 I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Act. O
To O
hold O
that O
Government O
servants O
are, O
as O
such O
and O
as O
a O
class, O
disqualified O
to O
act O
as O
polling O
agents O
would O
be O
to O
engraft O
an O
exception O
to O
the O
statute, O
which O
is O
not O
there. O
Accordingly, O
we O
reaffirm O
the O
view O
taken O
by O
us O
that O
the O
appointment O
of O
a O
Government O
servant O
as O
polling O
agent O
does O
not, O
without O
more, O
contravene O
section B-PROVISION
123(8). O
It O
is O
scarcely O
necessary O
to O
repeat O
our O
observation O
in O
the O
original O
judgment O
that O
if O
it O
is O
made O
out O
that O
the O
candidate O
or O
his O
agent O
had O
abused O
the O
right O
to O
appoint O
a O
Government O
servant O
as O
polling O
agent O
by O
exploiting O
the O
situation O
for O
furthering O
his O
election O
prospects, O
then O
the O
matter O
can O
be O
dealt O
with O
as O
an O
infringement O
of O

The O
position O
therefore O
is O
that O
if O
there O
is O
no O
necessity O
in O
fact O
or O
if O
the O
alienee O
could O
not O
prove O
that O
he O
made O
bona O
fide O
enquiries O
and O
was O
satisfied O
about O
its O
existence, O
the O
transfer O
is O
undoubtedly O
not O
void O
but O
the O
transferee O
would O
get O
only O
the O
widows O
estate O
in O
the O
property O
which O
does O
not O
affect O
in O
any O
way O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
reversioner. O
In O
this O
case O
the O
alienation O
was O
by O
way O
of O
mortgage. O
The O
finding O
of O
both O
the O
Courts O
below O
is O
that O
there O
was O
no O
legal O
necessity O
which O
justified O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
security O
bond. O
The O
mortgagee O
also O
could O
not O
prove O
that O
there O
was O
representation O
of O
the O
legal O
necessity O
and O
that O
she O
satisfied O
herself O
by O
bona O
fide O
enquiries O
that O
such O
necessity O
did O
exist. O
On O
this O
point O
the, O
finding O
recorded O
by O
the O
High O
Court O
is O
as O
follows O
In O
the O
present O
case, O
there O
is O
no O
scope O
for O
an O
argument O
that O
there O
was O
such O
representation O
of O
legal O
necessity O
or O
that O
on O
bona O
fide O
enquiry O
the O
alienee O
satisfied O
herself O
that O
there O
was O
such O
a O
necessity, O
for O
as O
I O
have O
already O
pointed O
out O
the O
security O
bond O
itself O
states O
that O
it O
was O
in O
consideration O
of O
benefits O
already O
received O
and O
with O
a O
view O
to O
induce O
Suhasini O
to O
forbear O
from O
proceeding O
against O
Mohini, O
that O
the O
bond O
was O
being O
executed. O
There O
is O
no O
representation O
in O
the O
bond O
that O
the O
alienation O
was O
made O
with O
a O
view O
to O
securing O
any O
benefit O
to O
the O
estate O
or O
to O
avert O
any O
danger O
to O
the O
estate O
or O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
any O
other O
legal O
necessity. O
Whatever O
enquiries O
the O
appellants O
may O
have O
made O
(1) O
6 O
M.I.A, O
would O
be O
of O
no O
avail O
to O
them O
when O
the O
alienation O
is O
not O
binding O
on O
the O
whole O
estate O
but O
only O
on O
the O
womans O
estate O
of O
Rashmoni. O
In O
our O
opinion O
the O
view O
taken O
by O
the O
High O
Court O
is O
quite O
proper. O
On O
this O
finding O
the O
security O
bond O
could O
operate O
only O
on O
the O
widows O
estate O
of O
Rashmoni O
and O
it O
was O
that O
interest O
alone O
which O
passed O
to O
the O
purchase. O
at O
the O
mortgage O
sale. O
The O
subsequent O
transferee O
could O
not O
claim O
to O
have O
acquired O
any O
higher O
right O
than O
what O
his O
predecessor O
had O
and O
it O
is O
immaterial O
whether O
he O
bona O
fide O
paid O
the O
purchase O
money O
or O
took O
proper O
legal O
advice. O

Since O
the O
dispute O
could O
not O
be O
settled O
amicably, O
the O
Union O
succeeded O
in O
persuading O
the O
Government O
of O
West O
Bengal O
to O
refer O
the O
dispute O
for O
adjudication O
to O
the O
Second O
Labour O
Court O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
the O
said O
discharge O
was O
not O
justified. O
That O
is O
how O
the O
discharge O
of O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjee I-OTHER_PERSON
became O
an O
industrial O
dispute O
between O
the O
appellant O
and O
the O
respondents, O
its O
workmen O
represented O
by O
their O
Union. O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjee I-OTHER_PERSON
stated O
in O
his O
evidence O
that O
he O
had O
all O
the O
cases O
opened O
and O
he O
added, O
as O
he. O
had O
to, O
that O
the O
said O
cases O
were O
repacked O
for O
avoiding O
further O
deterioration. O
When O
he O
was O
asked O
how O
that O
could O
be O
done, O
he O
agreed O
that O
the O
metal O
straps O
had O
to O
be O
removed O
for O
opening O
of O
the O
boxes, O
but O
he O
added O
that O
he O
had O
arranged O
to O
have O
them O
restrapped O
and O
nailed. O
It O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
strapping O
is O
done O
in O
a O
factory O
by O
machines. O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjee, O
however, O
suggested O
that O
he O
could O
manage O
to O
get O
the O
straps O
put O
and O
nailed O
with O
hands. O
This O
evidence O
is O
patently O
unreliable. O
Besides, O
it O
is O
significant O
that O
when O
he O
gave O
his O
explanation O
to O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Gupta I-OTHER_PERSON
Mr. O
Banerjee O
admitted O
that O
he O
had O
opened O
only O
5 O
or O
6 O
out O
of O
the O
20 O
boxes O
in O
question O
though O
his O
report O
suggested O
that O
he O
had O
opened O
all O
the O
20 O
boxes. O
Therefore, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
that O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Guptas I-OTHER_PERSON
statetment O
is O
absolutely O
true O
and O
that O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjee I-OTHER_PERSON
had O
made O
his O
report O
about O
the O
unsatisfactory O
condition O
of O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
20 O
boxes O
without O
as O
much O
as O
opening O
any O
one O
of O
them. O
That O
being O
so, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
understand O
how O
the O
Labour O
Court O
could O
-have O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
order O
of O
discharge O
was O
not O
justified. O
The O
learned O
Solicitor-General, O
however, O
attempted O
to O
argue O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
the O
record O
to O
show O
that O
the O
20 O
boxes O
which O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Gupta I-OTHER_PERSON
got O
opened O
were O
the O
same O
boxes O
in O
respect O
of O
which O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjee I-OTHER_PERSON
had O
made O
his O
report. O
We O
do O
not O
think O
that O
having O
regard O
to O
the O
evidence O
given O
by O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Gupta I-OTHER_PERSON
and O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjee I-OTHER_PERSON
and O
the O
explanation O
offered O
by O
the O
latter O
when O
he O
was O
called O
to O
Calcutta O
by O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Gupta, O
there O
is O
any O
room O
for O
such O
an O
ingenious O
suggestion. O
Both O
parties O
knew O
that O
they O
were O
talking O
about O
the O
same O
20 O
boxes O
and O
so,, O
it O
is O
futile O
now O
to O
suggest O
that O
the O
20 O
boxes O
which O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Gupta I-OTHER_PERSON
examined O
were O
different O
from O
the O
boxes O
in O
respect O
of O
which O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjee I-OTHER_PERSON
had O
made O
his O
report. O
It O
was O
also O
suggested O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
that O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Gupta I-OTHER_PERSON
did O
not O
admit O
that O
he O
had O
received O
some O
letters O
from O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjee I-OTHER_PERSON
in O
which O
he O
had O
complained O
that O
owing O
to O
heavy O
rains, O
conditions O
were O
not O
favourable O
for O
effective O
work O
in O
the O
area O
entrusted O
to O
him. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
when O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Gupta I-OTHER_PERSON
was O
asked O
about O
these O
letters, O
he O
said O
he O
did O
not O
remember O
if O
he O
had O
received O
them. O
We O
do O
not O
think O
that O
the O
answers O
given O
by O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Gupta I-OTHER_PERSON
in O
respect O
of O
these O
letters O
can O
be O
of O
any O
assistance O
to O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
in O
discrediting O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Guptas I-OTHER_PERSON
evidence O
in O
any O
manner. O
On O
the O
whole, O
we O
have O
no O
hesitation O
in O
holding O
that O
the O
appellant O
acted O
bonafide O
in O
discharging O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjees I-OTHER_PERSON
services O
when O
it O
accepted O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Guptas I-OTHER_PERSON
report O
and O
concurred O
with O
his O
conclusions O
that O
the O
explanation O
given O
by O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Banerjee I-OTHER_PERSON
was O
not O
satisfactory. O

This O
application O
however O
was O
rejected, O
because O
it O
was O
made O
at O
a O
very O
late O
stage, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
after O
the O
defendants O
evidence O
had O
been O
closed O
and O
an O
adjournment O
had O
been O
granted O
to O
the O
plaintiff O
to O
adduce O
rebutting O
evidence. O
However O
that O
may O
be, O
the O
utmost O
that O
can O
be O
said O
upon O
the O
evidence O
as O
it O
stands O
is O
that O
by O
the O
implied O
consent O
of O
the O
parties O
the O
period O
of O
the O
lease O
was O
extended O
up O
to O
the O
31st B-DATE
March, I-DATE
1938. O
In O
this O
view, O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
No. O
1 O
became O
entitled O
to O
re-enter O
after O
the O
31st O
March, O
and O
no O
notice O
under O
section B-PROVISION
106 I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Transfer O
of O
Property B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
was O
necessary. O
In O
the O
circumstances, O
the O
decree O
for O
ejectment O
passed O
by O
the O
courts O
below O
must O
be O
upheld. O
The O
next O
question O
which O
arises O
in O
the O
case O
turns O
on O
the O
proper O
construction O
of O
clause O
11 O
of O
Part O
I O
and O
clause O
1 O
of O
Part O
III O
of O
the O
lease, O
which O
have O
already O
been O
quoted. O
It O
seems O
to O
us O
that O
clause O
11 O
should O
be O
read O
as O
a O
whole, O
and, O
when O
it O
is O
so O
read, O
it O
becomes O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
intended O
to O
be O
applicable O
only O
where O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
decided O
to O
exercise O
his O
right O
to O
terminate O
the O
lease O
at O
any O
time O
subject O
to O
6 O
months O
notice, O
in O
the O
event O
of O
the O
lessee O
failing O
to O
observe O
and O
duly O
perform O
the O
conditions O
mentioned O
in O
the O
lease. O
In O
such O
a O
case, O
if O
the O
lessee O
did O
not O
remove O
the O
boilers, O
engines O
and O
all O
other O
materials O
and O
yield O
up O
the O
premises O
to O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State, O
those O
articles O
were O
to O
become O
the O
property O
of O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State. O
This O
clause O
is O
evidently O
not O
applicable O
to O
the O
present O
case. O
The O
clause O
which O
applies O
to O
this O
case O
is O
clause O
1 O
of O
Part O
III, O
which O
is O
intended O
to O
be O
applicable O
to O
the O
normal O
case O
of O
the O
lease O
expiring O
by O
efflux O
of O
time. O
This O
clause, O
as O
we O
have O
seen, O
provides O
that O
the O
lessee O
shall O
be O
at O
liberty O
to O
keep O
on O
the O
demised O
premises O
for O
3 O
months O
after O
the O
expiration O
of O
the O
lease O
any O
bricks, O
boilers, O
etc., O
but O
it O
also O
provides O
that O
any O
bricks O
and O
other O
materials O
left O
in O
contravention O
of O
this O
condition O
shall O
become O
the O
absolute O
property O
of O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
without O
payment. O
There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
that O
under O
this O
clause, O
the O
bricks O
and O
other O
materials O
have O
become O
the O
absolute O
property O
of O
the O
plaintiff. O
The O
only O
question O
is O
as O
to O
the O
meaning O
of O
other O
materials. O
It O
seems O
to O
us O
on O
an O
examination O
of O
the O
lease O
as O
a O
whole O
that O
there O
must O
be O
a O
distinction O
between O
materials, O
and O
machinery O
and O
tools O
and O
similar O
articles, O
and O
the O
words O
other O
materials O
have O
no O
reference O
to O
engines, O
trucks, O
railway O
and O
tramway O
lines O
and O
plant. O
They O
mean O
building O
materials O
such O
as O
bricks, O
tiles O
and O
similar O
articles O
that O
might O
have O
been O
manufactured O
by O
the O
appellants O
on O
the O
demised O
premises. O
That O
being O
so, O
the O
decree O
under O
appeal O
should O
be O
modified O
accordingly. O
The O
only O
other O
point O
which O
arises O
for O
consideration O
relates O
to O
the O
plaintiffs O
prayer O
for O
a O
decree O
for O
permanent O
injunction O
against O
the O
defendants, O
to O
restrain O
them O
from O
removing O
or O
otherwise O
disposing O
of O
the O
articles O
in O
regard O
to O
which O
the O
decree O
is O
to O
be O
passed. O
It O
was O
contended O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
appellants O
that O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
No. O

not O
being O
in O

asking O
for O
the O
declaration O
of O
its O
title O
in O
respect O
of O

and O
possession O
over O
them, O
and O
in O

After O
reading O
and O
fully O
considering O
those O
cases, O
we O
find O
them O
to O
be O
wholly O
inapplicable O
to O
the O
present O
case. O
In O
the O
present O
case, O
it O
has O
been O
found O
that O
the O

Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Swami I-OTHER_PERSON
reiterated O
the O
contention O
raised O
by O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Somayya I-OTHER_PERSON
that O
the O
Act O
was O
not O
duly O
passed O
by O
the O
legislature. O
For O
the O
reasons O
given O
in O
Petition O
No. O
166 O
of O
1951, O
I O
see O
no O
force O
in O
this O
contention, O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Swami I-OTHER_PERSON
also O
reiterated O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Bindras I-OTHER_PERSON
contention O
that O
the O
legislation O
was O
not O
bona O
fide. O
For O
the O
reasons O
given O
in O
Petition O
No. O
317, O
this O
contention O
is O
not O
accepted. O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Swami I-OTHER_PERSON
Vehemently I-OTHER_PERSON
argued O
that O
the O
Government O
has O
by O
this O
Act O
become O
a O
super- O
zamindar, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
public O
purpose O
behind O
the O
Act, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
change O
in O
the O
existing O
order O
of O
things, O
that O
the O
Act O
has O
achieved O
nothing O
new, O
the O
tenants O
remain O
as O
they O
were, O
the O
malikan O
cabza O
were O
also O
already O
in O
existence, O
that O
acquisition O
of O
that O
status O
by O
occupancy O
tenants O
was O
possible O
under O
existing O
statutes O
and O
that O
they O
had O
also O
the O
power O
of O
transfer O
of O
their O
holdings. O
In O
my O
opinion, O
the O
argument O
is O
based O
on O
a O
fallacy. O
As O
already O
stated, O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
Act O
is O
to O
bring O
about O
reforms O
in O
the O
land O
tenure O
system O
of O
the O
State O
by O
establishing O
direct O
contact O
between O
the O
tillers O
of O
the O
soil O
and O
the O
Government. O
These O
petitions O
are O
accordingly O
dismissed. O
I O
make O
no O
order O
of O
costs O
in O
them. O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Mukherji I-OTHER_PERSON
who O
appeared O
in O
this O
petition O
merely O
adopted O
the O
arguments O
taken O
in O
other O
petitioners. O
For O
the O
reasons O
given O
therein O
this O
petition O
is O
also O
dismissed, O
but O
I O
make O
no O
order O
as O
to O
costs O
in O
it. O
Petition O
No. O
487 O
of O
1951. O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Jog I-OTHER_PERSON
appeared O
in O
this O
petition O
and O
raised O
the O
same O
points O
as O
in O
other O
petitions. O
This O
petition O
also O
fails O
and O
is O
dismissed. O
There O
will O
be O
no O
order O
as O
to O
costs. O
Mukherjea, O
J. O
I O
agree O
with O
my O
Lord O
the O
Chief O
Justice O
that O
these O
petitions O
should O
be O
dismissed. O
All O
that O
the O
covenant O
does O
is O
to O
recognise O
the O
title O
of O
the O
Ruler O
as O
owner O
of O
certain O
properties. O
To O
say O
that O
the O
Ruler O
is O
the O
power O
of O
certain O
properties O
is O
not O
to O
say O
that O
those O
properties O
shall O
in O
no O
circumstances O
be O
acquired O
by O
the O
State. O
The O
fact O
that O
his O
personal O
properties O
are O
sought O
to O
be O
acquired O
on O
payment O
of O
compensation O
clearly O
recognises O
his O
title O
just O
as O
the O
titles O
of O
other O
proprietors O
are O
recognised. O

It O
is O
against O
the O
order O
of O
the O
Board O
of O
Revenue O
that O
the O
appellant O
has O
come O
in O
appeal O
by O
special O
leave O
but O
has O
not O
appeared O
against O
the O
judgment O
and O
order O
of O
the O
High O
Court. O
This O
Court O
in O
M O
s. O
Chimmonalall B-ORG
Rameshwarlall I-ORG
Commissioner O
of O
Income-tax O
(Central) O
Calcutta O
(1) O
held O
that O
in O
cases O
where O
a O
reference O
is O
made O
to O
the O
High O
Court O
and O
the O
appeal O
is O
brought O
only O
against O
the O
order O
of O
the O
Income O
Tax O
Appellate O
Tribunal O
then O
the O
Supreme B-COURT
Court, O
if O
it O
interfered, O
would O
in O
fact O
be O
setting O
aside O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O
High O
Court O
without O
there O
being O
an O
appeal O
to O
this O
Court, O
and O
that O
this O
Court O
could O
not O
bypass O
the O
normal O
procedure O
which O
was O
to O
be O
adopted O
for O
the O
purpose. O
In O
a O
later O
Judgment O
in O
Chandi O
Prasad O
Chokhani O
v. O
State O
of O
Bihar O
(2)a O
similar O
view O
was O
taken O
that O
as O
the O
assessee O
had O
not O
obtained O
Special O
Leave O
in O
respect O
of O
any O
of O
the O
orders O
passed O
by O
the O
High O
Court O
under O
s. O
25 O
those O
orders O
became O
final O
and O
binding O
and O
the O
assessee O
could O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
bypass O
or O
go O
behind O
the O
orders O
of O
the O
High O
Court O
and O
such O
exercise O
would O
be O
particularly O
inadvisable O
in O
a O
case O
where O
the O
result O
may O
be O
a O
conflict O
of O
the O
decision O
of O
two O
courts O
of O
competent O
jurisdiction, O
which O
was O
contrary O
to O
the O
object O
of O
ss. O
23, O
24 O
and O
25 O
of O
the O
Act. O
In O
this O
view O
of O
the O
law O
the O
appellant O
is O
not O
entitled O
to O
agitate O
the O
correctness O
or O
otherwise O
of O
the O
decision O
given O
by O
the O
Tribunal O
in O
regard O
to O
the O
questions O
which O
we O
agitated O
before O
the O
High O
Court O
and O
were O
decided O
against O
the O
appellant O
and O
against O
which O
no O
appeal O
has O
been O
brought. O
But O
he O
submits O
that O
there O
are O
three O
other O
questions O
which O
also O
arise, O
and O
on O
which O
the O
appellant O
wanted O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
High O
Court O
but O
which O
were O
not O
referred. O
It O
was O
open O
to O
the O
appellant O
to O
apply O
to O
the O
High O
Court O
for O
a O
reference O
under O
s. O
25. O
That O
the O
appellant O
did O
not O
do, O
and O
it O
has O
not O
been O
shown O
that O
there O
was O
any O
such O
breach O
of O
the O
rules O
of O
natural O
justice O
or O
violation O
of O
any O
principal O
of O
law O
which O
would O
be O
a O
good O
ground O
for O
our O
interference O
direct O
with O
the O
orders O
of O
the O
Board O
of O
Revenue O
in O
an O
appeal O
under O
Art. O
136 O
of O
the O
Constitution. O
