J. O
The O
High B-COURT
Court I-COURT
of I-COURT
Judicature I-COURT
at O
Bombay O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
the O
following O
two O
questions O
which O
were O
referred O
by O
the O
Income-tax O
Appellate O
Tribunal, O
Bombay, O
under O
sections O
66(2) O
of O
the O
Income-tax O
Act. O
Whether O
on O
the O
facts O
and O
in O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
case O
the O
Tribunal O
was O
justified O
in O
law O
in O
adding O
to O
the O
total O
income O
of O
the O
assessee O
the O
sum O
of O
Rs. O
1,45,706 O
and O
or O
Rs. O
48,185 O
or O
any O
part O
thereof O
? O
Whether O
there O
was O
any O
material O
on O
record O
to O
support O
the O
finding O
that O
Rs. O
1,45,706 O
and O
or O
48,185 O
or O
any O
part O
thereof O
represent O
the O
income O
of O
the O
assessee O
? O
Again O
the O
evidence O
of O
Achaldas O
and O
Poonamchand O
clearly O
showed O
that O
these O
amounts O
were O
repaid. O
In O
the O
statements O
made O
by O
these O
two O
persons O
before O
the O
Income- O
tax O
Officer O
it O
was O
asserted O
that O
the O
repayment O
of O
the O
amounts O
of O
the O
cheques O
was O
made O
to O
the O
assessees. O
Before O
the O
Appellate B-ORG
Assistant I-ORG
Commissioner O
they O
stated O
that O
they O
handed O
over O
the O
moneys O
to O
some O
other O
persons O
whose O
presence O
could O
not O
be O
procured. O
There O
is O
nothing O
on O
the O
record O
to O
show O
that O
the O
Income-tax O
Officer O
had O
not O
disclosed O
to O
the O
assessees O
the O
material O
he O
had O
collected O
by O
examining O
Achaldas O
and O
Poonamchand. O
In O
any O
event, O
the O
Appellate B-ORG
Assistant I-ORG
Commissioner O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
justice O
and O
fair O
play O
gave O
the O
assessees O
an O
opportunity O
to O
cross-examine O
these O
two O
persons. O
The O
Income-tax O
Officer O
is O
not O
bound O
by O
any O
technical O
rules O
of O
the O
law O
of O
evidence. O
It O
is O
open O
to O
him O
to O
collect O
materials O
to O
facilitates O
assessment O
even O
by O
private O
enquiry. O
But O
if O
he O
desires O
to O
use O
the O
material O
so O
collected, O
the O
assessee O
must O
be O
informed O
of O
the O
material O
and O
must O
be O
given O
an O
adequate O
opportunity O
of O
explaining O
it. O
The O
statements O
made O
by O
Achaldas O
and O
Poonamchand O
before O
the O
Income-tax O
Officer O
were O
material O
on O
which O
the O
income-tax O
authorities O
could O
act O
provided O
that O
the O
material O
was O
disclosed O
and O
the O
assessees O
had O
opportunity O
to O
render O
their O
explanation O
in O
that O
behalf. O
It O
was O
therefore O
open O
to O
the O
Tribunal O
in O
appreciating O
the O
evidence O
to O
rely O
upon O
the O
statements O
made O
by O
Achaldas O
and O
Poonamchand O
before O
the O
Income-tax O
Officer O
and O
to O
disbelieve O
the O
statements O
made O
by O
them O
before O
the O
Appellate B-ORG
Assistant I-ORG
Commissioner. O
The O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
High O
Court O
under O
section B-PROVISION
66 I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Income-tax O
Act O
is O
merely O
advisory. O
The O
High O
Court O
does O
not O
sit O
in O
appeal O
over O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O
income-tax O
authorities O
it O
is O
not O
concerned O
to O
decide O
whether O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
Tribunal O
on O
appreciation O
of O
evidence O
is O
correct. O
There O
was O
apparently O
a O
mass O
of O
evidence O
on O
which O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
Appellate O
Tribunal O
could O
be O
founded O
and O
the O
question O
which O
fell O
to O
be O
determined O
by O
it O
was O
purely O
one O
of O
fact. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
a O
finding O
of O
fact O
which O
is O
not O
supported O
by O
any O
evidence O
or O
is O
unreasonable O
and O
perverse O
may O
be O
open O
to O
challenge O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
it O
is O
not O
supported O
by O
any O
material O
on O
the O
record, O
but, O
as O
we O
have O
already O
observed, O
there O
was O
material O
on O
which O
the O
Income-tax O
Tribunal O
could O
reasonably O
arrive O
at O
the O
conclusion O
which O
it O
did. O
The O
High O
Court O
was, O
therefore, O
right O
in O
recording O
the O
answers O
to O
the O
two O
questions O
submitted O
to O
it. O

This O
is O
for O
facilitating O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
Code O
but O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
the O
other O
persons O
in O
whose O
favour O
the O
occupancy O
is O
relinquished O
cease O
to O
have O
any O
right. O
That O
their O
right O
as O
occupants O
remains O
is O
clearly O
recognised O
by O
the O
opening O
paragraph O
of O
the O
section O
which O
gives O
an O
occupant O
a O
right O
to O
relinquish O
his O
occupancy O
either O
absolutely O
or O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
specified O
person. O
This O
right O
is O
given O
to O
all O
occupants, O
if O
there O
are O
more O
than O
one, O
for O
the O
singular O
includes O
the O
plural. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
where O
there O
are O
more O
occupants O
than O
one, O
the O
notice O
of O
relinquishment O
on O
behalf O
of O
any O
occupant O
must O
be O
given O
by O
the O
registered O
occupant. O
That O
does O
not O
mean, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
specific O
pleading O
and O
cogent O
proof, O
that O
a O
notice O
of O
relinquishment O
given O
by O
the O
registered O
occupant O
must O
necessarily O
be O
a O
notice O
on O
behalf O
of O
all O
occupants O
or O
any O
particular O
occupant O
other O
than O
the O
registered O
occupant, O
or O
that O
the O
registered O
occupant O
has O
the O
right O
to O
give O
such O
a O
notice O
without O
reference O
to O
the O
other O
occupants O
so O
as O
to O
effect O
their O
interest O
in O
the O
occupancy. O
Turning O
to O
the O
Rajinama, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
Shiddappa O
did O
not O
purport O
to O
file, O
the O
same O
on O
behalf O
of O
Annappa O
nor O
had O
he O
any O
right O
to O
do O
so O
by O
reason O
only O
of O
his O
being O
the O
registered O
occupant. O

(1) O
one O
out O
of O
four O
brother O
mortgagors, O
who O
was O
the O
registered O
occupant O
of O
the O
mortgage O
land, O
passed O
a O
Rajinama O
of O
the O
land O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
mortgagee, O
who O
executed O
a O
Kabuliyat O
for O
the O
same. O
The O
remaining O
three O
mortgagors O
sued O
to O
redeem O
the O
mortgage O
alleging O
that O
the O
Rajinama O
passed O
by O
their O
brother O
conveyed O
only O
his O
interest O
and O
nothing O
more. O
It O
was O
held O
that O
though O
the O
conveying O
brother O
was O
a O
co-mortgagor O
with O
the O
plaintiffs, O
he O
had O
no O
right O
to O
sell O
their O
interest O
in O
the O
equity O
of O
redemption O
and O
that, O
so O
far O
as O
they, O
were O
concerned, O
he O
was O
in O
the O
same O
position O
as O
an O
outsider. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
no O
specific O
reference O
was O
made O
in O
the O
judgment O
to O
s. O
74 O
of O
the O
Bombay B-STATUTE
Land I-STATUTE
Revenue I-STATUTE
Code, I-STATUTE
but O
the O
actual O
decision O
in O
that O
case, O
the O
facts O
of O
which O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
the O
instant O
case, O
quite O
clearly O
indicates O
the O
courts O
understanding O
of O
the O
law O
applicable O
to O
those O
facts O
and O
that O
law O
was O
nothing O
but O
the O
provisions O
of O
s. O
74 O
of O
the O
Code. O
In O
our O
opinion, O
on O
a O
correct O
interpretation O
of O
s. O
74, O
where O
there O
are O
more O
occupants O
than O
one O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
same O
occupancy O
each O
occupant O
has O
his O
own O
rights O
and O
the O
fact O
of O
registration O
of O
one O
of O
them O
as O
the O
registered O
occupant O
attracts O
the O
operation O
of O
the O
Code O
and O
confers O
certain O
rights O
or O
imposes O
certain O
obligations O
on O
the O
registered O
occupant O
as O
laid O
down O
in O
the O
Code O
but O
does O
not O
take O
away O
the O
rights O
of O
other O
occupants. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
if O
any O
of O
the O
occupants O
other O
than O
the O
registered O
occupant O
desires O
to O
relinquish O
his O
occupancy. O
he O
cannot O
himself O
give O
a O
notice O
of O
relinquishment O
but O
must O
give O
it O
by O
and O
through O
the O
registered O
occupant O
Nevertheless O
the O
registered O
occupant, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
authority, O
express O
or O
implied, O
to O

clearly O

This O
appeal O
on O
a O
certificate O
of O
fitness O
granted O
by O
the O
High O
Court O
under O
Act O
134(1), O
(c). O
of O
the O
Constitution, O
is O
directed O
against O
the O
order O
of O
a O
Division O
Bench O
of O
the O
Calcutta O
High O
Court O
dated O
December O
21, O
1960, O
setting O
aside O
the O
order O
of O
acquittal O
passed O
by O
the O
trial O
Magistrate, O
dated O
July O
2, O
1958. O
We O
heard O
this O
appeal O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
long O
vacation O
and O
pronounced O
our O
order O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
the O
appeal O
was O
allowed O
and O
the O
order O
of O
acquittal O
was O
to O
stand, O
and O
that O
reasons O
would O
be O
given O
later. O
It O
appears O
that O
the O
appellant, O
who O
it O
a O
practising O
lawyer, O
had O
been O
employed O
by O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
to O
work O
for O
him O
to O
investigate O
the O
title O
to O
some O
property O
which O
the O
latter O
was O
about O
to O
purchase, O
sometime O
in O
October O
1952. O
The O
prosecution O
case O
was O
that O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
had O
entrusted O
the. O
sum O
of O
Rs. O
5000/- O
to O
the O
appellant O
for O
depositing O
in O
Court O
in O
connection O
with O
an O
application O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
proposed O
transaction, O
under O
the O
Bengal B-STATUTE
Money I-STATUTE
Lenders I-STATUTE
Act, I-STATUTE
and O
that O
the O
appellant O
having O
been O
so O
entrusted O
with O
the O
money, O
in O
breach O
of O
trust, O
misappropriated O
the O
amount, O
thus O
causing O
loss O
to O
his O
client. O
The O
appellant O
was, O
therefore, O
charged O
under O
s. O
409 O
of O
the O
Indian B-STATUTE
Penal I-STATUTE
Code, I-STATUTE
with O
having O
committed O
criminal O
breach O
of O
trust O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
sum O
of O
Rs. O
5000/- O
, O
which O
had O
been O
entrusted O
to O
him O
as O
a O
lawyer O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
respondent. O
It O
is O
not O
a O
case O
where O
it O
in O
open O
to O
the O
Court O
of O
Appeal, O
against O
an O
order O
of O
acquittal, O
to O
order O
a O
retrial O
for O
the O
reasons O
that O
the O
trial O
Court O
has O
not O
given O
the O
prosecution O
full O
opportunity O
to O
adduce O
all O
available O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
the O
prosecution O
case. O
It O
has O
no O
where O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
trial O
Magistrate O
had O
unreasonably O
refused O
any O
opportunity O
to O
the O
prosecution O
to O
adduce O
all O
the O
evidence O
that O
it O
was O
ready O
and O
willing O
to O
produce. O
That O
being O
so, O
the O
High O
Court, O
in O
our O
judgment, O
entirely O
misdirected O
itself O
in O
setting O
aside O
the O
order O
of O
acquittal O
and O
making O
an O
order O
for O
a O
fresh O
trial O
by O
another O
Magistrate, O
simply O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
the O
case O
was O
between O
a O
lawyer O
and O
his O
client. O
Simply O
because O
the O
accused O
happened O
to O
be O
a O
lawyer O
would O
not O
be O
a O
ground O
for O
subjecting O
him O
to O
harassment O
a O
second O
time, O
there O
being O
no O
reason O
for O
holding O
that O
his O
prosecutor O
had O
not O
a O
fair O
chance O
of O
bringing O
the O
charge O
home O
to O
him. O
In O
our O
opinion, O
the O
High O
Court O
gave O
way O
to O
considerations O
which O
were O
not O
relevant O
to O
a O
criminal O
trial. O
The O
High O
Court O
was O
not O
sitting O
on O
a O
disciplinary O
proceeding O
for O
professional O
misconduct. O
It O
had O
to O
apply O
the O
same O
rules O
of O
criminal O
jurisprudence O
as. O
apply O
to O
all O
criminal O
trials, O
and, O
in O
our O
opinion, O
the O
only. O
reason O
given O
by O
the O
High O
Court O
for O
ordering O
retrial O
is O
against O
all O
well-established O
rules O
of O
criminal O
jurisprudence. O
The O
fact O
that O
the O
appellant O
is O
a O
practising O
lawyer O
does O
not O
entitle O
him O
to O
any O
preferential O
treatment O
when O
he O
is O
hauled O
up O
on O
a O
criminal O
charge, O
even O
as O
he O
is O
not O
subject O
to O
any O
additional O
disability O
because O
the O
cam O
was O
between O
a O
lawyer O
and O
his O
client. O
There O
was O
no O
relationship O
of O
lawyer O
and O
client O
so O
far O
as O
the O
criminal O
case O
was O
concerned. O

High B-COURT
Court I-COURT
of I-COURT
Madras I-COURT
allowing O
a O
petition O
under O
Article O
226 O
of O
the O

The O
question O
there O
raised O
was O
the O
legality O
of O
the O
assessment O
of O
Sales O

by O
appellant O
No. O

the O
Deputy O

Officer, O

under O

Tax I-STATUTE
Act, I-STATUTE
1939 I-STATUTE
(Act O
IX O
of O
1939), O
hereinafter O
termed O
the O
Act. O
The O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
was O
a O
partnership O
firm O
carrying O
on O
tannery O
business O
at O
Chromepet O
near O
the O
city O
of O
Madras. O
Before O
the O
year O
of O
assessment, O
i. O
e., O
1952-53, O
it O
was O
taking O
out O
licences O
under O
the O
relevant O
provisions O
of O
the O
Act O
but O
it O
did O
not O
renew O
the O
licence O
for O
the O
assessment O
year. O
When O
called O
upon O
to O
make O
a O
return O
it O
did O
not O
do O
so O
nor O
did O
it O
raise O
any O
objection O
to O
the O
notice O
served O
on O
it O
on O
February O
28, O
1954. O
It O
was O
assessed O
to O
sales O
tax O
of O
Rs. O
10,584 O
on O
a O
turnover O
of O
Rs. O
6,77,374-4-4. O
It O
filed O
a O
petition O
under O
Art. O
226 O
to O
quash O
the O
assessment O
order O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
the O
order O
was O
illegal O
and O
not O
supported O
by O
the O
authority O
of O
law. O
This O
contention O
was O
accepted O
by O
the O
High O
Court O
and O
the O
petition O
was O
allowed O
with O
costs. O
The O
consequence O
of O
the O
judgment O
is O
that O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
firm O
which O
is O
not O
a O
licensed O
dealer O
under O
the O

is O
not O
liable O
to O
any O
sales O
tax O
in O
respect O
of O
its O
dealings O
in O
hides O
and O
skins. O
This, O
it O
appears, O
was O
not O
disputed O
by O
the O
Government O
and O
it O
was O
therefore O
held O
that O

the O
contention O
of O
the O
petitioners B-PETITIONER
is O
that O
where O
there O
are O
sales O
by O
unlicensed O
dealers O
to O
unlicensed O
tanners O
or O
unlicensed O
dealers, O
there O
is O
the O
possibility O
of O
multiple O
taxation O
and O
that O
would O
be O
in O
violation O
of O
section B-PROVISION
5(vi). O
It O
is O
not O
disputed O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Government O
that O
Rule O
16(5) O
is O
repugnant O
to O
section B-PROVISION
5(vi). O
It O
must O
therefore O
be O
held O
to O
be O
ultra O
vires. O
But O
this O
can O
bring O
no O
relief O
to O
the O
petitioners, O
as O
they O
are O
all O
licensed O
tanners O
and O
are O
in O
no O
manner O
hurt O
by O
the O
operation O
of O
r. O
16(5). O
This O
was O
conceded O
by O
the O
learned O
Advocate O
for O
the O
petitioners B-PETITIONER
. O
This O
case O
was O
then O
brought O
in O
appeal O
to O
this O
Court O
and O
S. O
R. O
Das, O
J. O
(as O
he O
then O
was), O
observed O
at O
p. O
1121- O
Lastly, O
the O
learned O
advocate O
urges O
that O
rule B-PROVISION
16 I-PROVISION
(5) O
clearly O
contravenes O
the O
provisions O
of O
section B-PROVISION
5(vi) I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Act. O
This O
sub-rule O
has O
been O
held O
to O
be O
ultra O
vires O
by O
the O
High O
Court, O
and O
indeed, O
the O
learned O
Advocate B-LAWYER
General I-LAWYER
of O
Madras O
did O
not O
in O
the O
High O
Court, O
as O
before O
us, O
dispute O
that O
rule B-PROVISION
16(5) O
was O
repugnant O
to O
,section O
5(vi). O
That O
sub-rule, O
however O
affects O
only O
unlicensed O
dealers O
and O
the O
appellants O
who O
are O
admittedly O
licensed O
dealers O
are O
not O
affected O
by O
that O
sub-rule O
. O

The O

There O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
any O
written O
agreement O
between O
the O
two O
manufacturers O
and O
the O

but O
the O

In O

of O
this O
agreement O
the O

received O

thus O
making O
a O
total O
of O
Rs. O
40,504. O
These O
cheques O
were O
sent O
by O

and O
when O

at O

were O
credited O
in O

As O
against O
these O

the O

at O
once O

thus O
operated O
on O
these O

deposited. O
In O
regard O
to O
the O
commission O
received O
from O
the O
Bombay O
firm O
it O
was O
paid O
into O
the O

on O
December O
22, O
1944, O
but O
was O
given O
credit O
for O
only O
on O
January O
2, O
1945. O
The O
Income-tax O
Officer O
assessed O
these O
sums O
as O
taxable O
income O
holding O
that O
the O
entire O
amount O
of O
Rs. O
40,504 O
was O
received O
in O
British O
India O
and O
not O
at O
Secunderabad. O
An O
appeal O
was O
taken O
by O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
to O
the O
Appellate B-ORG
Assistant I-ORG
Commissioner O
who O
upheld O
the O
order O
holding O
that O
income O
must O
be O
held O
to O
have O
accrued, O
arisen O
or O
received O
in O
British O
India. O
Against O
this O
order O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
took O
an O
appeal O
to O
the O
Income-tax O
Appellate O
Tribunal O
and O
it O
was O
held O
that O
the O
amounts O
were O
received O
by O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
from O
Madura O
and O
Bombay O
firms O
as O
commission O
but O
they O
were O
received O
at O
Secunderabad. O
The O
appeal O
was O
therefore O
allowed. O
The O
finding O
Of O
the O
Appellate O
Tribunal O
in O
their O
own O
words O
was- O
The O
contention O
of O
the O
Appellants O
is O
that O
the O
cheques O
being O
negotiable O
instruments O
and O
the O
creditor O
having O
accepted O
them O
and O
passed O
through O
their O
books, O
II O
the O
receipt O
must O
be O
taken O
to O
be O
receipts O
in O
Hyderabad. O
We O
agree O
with O
the O
view O
submitted O
by O
the O
appellants. O
It O
was O
further O
contended O
that O
in O
this O
case O
there O
was O
an O
express O
agreement O
that O
the O
payment O
was O
to O
be O
made O
at O
Secunderabad O
and O
therefore O
the O
matter O
does O
not O
fall O
within O
the O
rule O
in O
Ogale O
Glass O
Works O
case O
(1) O
and O
the O
following O
principle O
laid O
down O
in O
judgment O
by O
Das, O
J. O
(as O
he O
then O
was), O
is O
inapplicable O
- O
Applying O
the O
above O
principles O
to O
the O
facts O
found O
by O
the O
Tribunal O
the O
position O
appears O
to O
be O
this. O
The O
engagement O
of O
the O
Government O
was O
to O
make O
payment O
by O
cheques. O
The O
cheques O
were O
drawn O
in O
Delhi O
and O
received O
by O
the O
assessee O
in O
Aundh O
by O
post. O

Special O
leave O
granted. O
Respondent B-RESPONDENT
1 O
was O
suspended O
by O
order O
dated O
28 O
7 O
1998 O
on O
the O
same O
day O
when O
disciplinary O
proceedings O
were O
initiated O
against O
him. O
He O
filed O
a O
writ O
petition O
in O
the O
High O
Court O
challenging O
the O
order O
of O
suspension. O
By O
the O
impugned O
order O
the O
High O
Court O
noted O
that O
Respondent B-RESPONDENT
I O
had O
been O
empanelled O
for O
promotion O
to O
the O
post O
of O
Joint B-ORG
Commissioner O
on O
28 O
5 O
1998 O
and O
the O
disciplinary O
proceedings O
commenced O
on O
28 O
7 O
1998 O
and O
on O
the O
same O
day O
i.e O
28 O
7 O
1998 O
he O
was O
suspended. O
From O
this O
the O
High O
Court O
concluded O
that O
the O
act O
of O
suspension O
was O
an O
after O
thought. O
Consequently O
the O
High O
Court O
directed O
that O
no O
effect O
should O
be O
given O
to O
the O
order O
of O
suspension O
and O
the O
select O
list O
for O
promotion O
should O
be O
given O
effect O
to O
forthwith. O
We O
are O
at O
a O
loss O
the O
understand O
as O
to O
how O
the O
High O
Court O
could O
pass O
such O
an O
order. O
Admittedly O
the O
disciplinary O
proceedings O
had O
commenced O
on O
28 O
7 O
1998. O
Even O
if O
before O
that O
date O
the O
said O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
had O
been O
empanelled O
for O
promotion O
the O
Government O
cannot O
be O
prohibited O
from O
starting O
disciplinary O
proceedings O
if O
there O
are O
reasons O
for O
doing O
so. O
The O
High O
Court O
has O
not O
quashed O
the O
disciplinary O
proceedings O
and O
looking O
at O
the O
charges O
leveled O
against O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
it O
cant O
of O
be O
said O
that O
there O
was O
any O
ulterior O
motive O
for O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
being O
put O
under O
suspension. O
Furthermore O
where O
disciplinary O
proceedings O
are O
pending O
we O
are O
doubtful O
whether O
it O
was O
appropriate O
for O
the O
High O
Court O
to O
have O
directed O
that O
the O
select O
list O
for O
promotion O
should O
be O
given O
effect O
to O
forthwith O
especially O
when O
the O
High O
Court O
in O
the O
said O
order O
has O
permitted O
the O
disciplinary O
proceedings O
to O
continue. O
It O
is O
also O
difficult O
to O
appreciate O
the O
High O
Court O
holding O
that O
even O
though O
disciplinary O
proceedings O
could O
continue O
but O
no O
final O
order O
should O
be O
passed. O
No O
reasons O
for O
coming O
to O
this O
conclusion O
have O
been O
given. O
We O
therefore O
have O
no O
hesitation O
in O
set O
ting O
aside O
the O
impugned O
judgment O
of O
the O
High O
Court. O
The O
effect O
of O
this O
would O
be O
that O
Respondent B-RESPONDENT
1 O
who O
was O
reinstated O
pursuant O
to O
an O
order O
passed O
by O
the O
High O
Court O
during O
the O
proceedings O
for O
contempt O
which O
are O
stated O
to O
have O
been O
initiated O
by O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
would O
be O
placed O
under O
suspension O
forthwith O
till O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
disciplinary O
proceedings O
or O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
suspension O
order O
by O
the O
Government. O

party O
and O
-whether O
by O
the O

him O
the O

bad. O

1953, O
the O

otherwise. O
The O
view O
of O
the O
majority O
was O
that O
the O
mandatory O
nature O
of O
the O
provisions O
of O
section B-PROVISION
82 I-PROVISION
itself O
contains O
within O
it O
the O
-consequence O
of O
dismissal O
for O
non-compliance O
with O
its O
provisions O
and O
a O
separate O
provision O
for O
the O
dismissal O
of O
the O
petition O
for O
non-compliance O
with O
its O
provisions O
was O
not O
necessary O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
superfluous. O
These O
observations O
run O
counter O
to O
the O
scheme O
of O
the O
Act O
itself O
as O
envisaged O
by O
section B-PROVISION
85. O
The O
provisions O
of O
sections O

117 O

also O
mandatory O
and O
still O
in O

it O

The O
member O
of O
the O

In O
dealing O
with O
the O
question, O
the O
learned O
Judges O
of O
the O

felt O
that O
s. O
13 O
of O
the O

was O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
a O
general O
law, O
over O
which O
the O
special O
procedure O
prescribed O

19 O
of O
the O
Act O
read O
with O
s. O
386 O
of O
the O
Code O

Criminal O
Procedure O
was O
to O
prevail. O
They, O
however, O
thought O
that, O
since O
all O
the O
processes O
available O
under O
s. O
19 O
of O
the O
Act O
were O
also O
available O
under O
s. O
386 O
of O
the O
Code O
of O
Criminal O
Procedure, O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
decide O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
the O
proceedings O
under O
s. O
386 O
came O
to O
nothing. O
They O
observed O
that O
if O
the O
question O
arose, O
they O
would O
consider O
it. O
The O
writ O
of O
prohibition O
was O
granted O
by O
the O
High O
Court. O
The O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
did O
not O
appear O
in O
this O
Court. O
We O
have O
heard O
learned O
counsel O
for O
the O
appellants, O
who O
has O
drawn O
our O
attention O
to O
all O
the O
relevant O
provisions O
of O
the O
law. O
The O
question O
which O
arises O
is O
whether O
s. O
19 O
must O
be O
taken O
to O
prevail O
over O
s. O
13 O
of O
the O
Act. O
Both O
the O
sections O
lay O
down O
the O
mode O
for O
recovery O
of O
arrears O
of O
tax, O
and, O
as O
has O
already O
been O
noticed O
by O
the O
High O
Court, O
lead O
to O
the O
application O
of O
the O
process O
for O
recovery O
by O
attachment O
and O
sale O
of O
movable O
and O
immovable O
properties, O
belonging O
to O
the O
tax-evader. O
It O
cannot O
be O
said O
that O
one O
proceeding O
is O
more O
general O
than O
the O
other, O
because O
there O
is O
much O
that O
is O
common O
between O
them, O
in O
so O
far O
as O
the O
mode O
of O
recovery O
is O
concerned. O
Section O
19, O
in O
addition O
to O
recovery O
of O
the O
amount, O
gives O
the O
power O
to O
the O
Magistrate O
to O
convict O
and O
sentence O
the O
offender O
to O
fine O
or O
in O
default O
of O
payment O
of O
fine, O
to O
imprisonment. O

The O
main O
consideration O
which O
influenced O
the O
tribunal O
in O
passing O
the O
order O
which O
it O
did O
was O
that O
in O
the O
view O
of O
the O
tribunal O
Ramkrishna O
Prasad O
was O
superseded O
by O
Babulal O
Parekh O
who O
was O
first O
appointed O
as O
a O
clerk O
under O
him. O

S.C.R. O

the O
tribunal O
in O
our O
opinion O
is O
patently O
erroneous. O
The O
appointment O
order O
dated O
October O
4, O
1952, O
clearly O
shows O
that O
Babulal O
Parekh O
was O
appointed O
as O
store O
inches O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
at O
Rs. O
180 O
per O
month. O
The O
tribunal O
referred O
to O
certain O
entries O
in O
the O
attendance O
register O
to O
hold O
that O
Babulal O
Parekh O
worked O
as O
clerk O
to O
begin O
with. O
It O
appears O
from O
the O
attendance O
register O
for O
the O
months O
of O
October, O
November O
and O
December O
that O
Babulal O
Parekh O
was O
marked O
present O
from O
October O
7 O
to O
November O
9. O
Thereafter O
from O
November O
11 O
to O
the O
end O
of O
December O
he O
signed O
the O
attendance O
register. O
The O
statement O
of O
Cbaudhari, O
Labour O
Welfare O
Officer O
of O
the O
mill O
was O
that O
the O
practice O
in O
the O
mill O
was O
that O
officers O
used O
to O
be O
marked O
present O
in O
the O
attendance O
register O
while O
clerks O
used O
to O
sign O
it O
themselves. O
The O
tribunal O
has O
concluded O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
Babulal. O
Parekh O
signed O
the O
register O
in O
November O
that O
he O
must O
have O
been O
a O
clerk O
to O
begin O
with. O
The O
tribunal, O
however, O
completely O
overlooked O
that O
from O
October O
7 O
to O
November O
9, O
Babulal O
Parekh O
was O
marked O
present O
which O
would O
show O
that O
he O
was O
not O
a O
clerk. O
The O
tribunal O
also O
overlooked O
that O
even O
from O
November O
28 O
to O
the O
end O
of O
December O
when O
Babulal O
Parekh O
admittedly O
was O
not O
a O
clerk O
but O
store O
in- O
charge O
he O
still O
signed O
the O
register, O
though O
he O
should O
have O
been O
marked O
present. O
Chaudhari O
was O
unable O
to O
explain O
how O
this O
happened, O
but O
he O
was O
hardly O
the O
person O
to O
explain O
this. O
It O
is, O
however, O
clear O
from O
this O
confusion O
that O
no O
importance O
can O
be O
attached O
to O
whether O
Babulal O
Parekh O
was O
marked O
present O
in O
the O
register O
or O
signed O
it. O
The O
real O
thing O
which O
determined O
the O
status O
of O
Babulal O
Parekh O
was O
the O
appointment O
order O
dated O
October O
4, O
1952, O
which O
the O
tribunal O
has O
accepted O
as O
correct. O
A O
question O
was O
certainly O
put O
to O
Chaudhari O
at O
the O
end O
of O
his O
cross-examination O
that O
he O
had O
manufactured O
the O
statements O
put O
in O
by O
him O
only O
the O
night O
before O
but O
he O
denied O
it. O
We O
cannot O
accept O
the O
suggestion O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
that O
the O
appointment O
order O
was O
ante-dated, O
for O
no O
such O
suggestion O
was O
made O
to O
Chaudhari O
and O
the O
tribunal O
itself O
does O
not O
find O
so. O
It O
is O
clear O
therefore O
that O
the O
finding O
of O
the O
tribunal O
that O
Babulal O
Parekh O
was O
appointed O
as O
clerk O
under O
Ramkrishna O
Prasad O
to O
begin O
with O
is O
patently O
perverse O
and O
it O
must O
be O
held O
that O
Babulal O
Parekh O
was O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
working O
as O
store O
in-charge. O
Now O
in O
so O
far O
as O
Ramkrishna O
Prasad O
was O
concerned O
his O
work O
and O
emoluments O
remained O
the O
same O
after O
the O
appointment O
of O
Babulal O
Parekh. O
If O
a O
higher O
post O
was O
created O
in O
the O
Stores B-ORG
Department I-ORG
because O
of O
the O
increase O
in O
work, O
Ramkrishna O
Prasad O
could O
not O
claim O
promotion O
to O
it O
merely O
because O
he O
was O
working O
as O
a O
store-keeper O
before. O

In O
our O
view O
the O
above O
observation O
is O
apposite O
and O
applies O
to O
the O
case O
before O
us. O
The O
true O
implication O
of O
the O
above O
observation O
as O
of O
the O
decisions O
in O
the O
other O
cases O
referred O
to O
above O
is O
that O
the O
pre-existing O
right O
of O
appeal O
is O
not O
destroyed O
by O
the O
amendment O
if O
the O
amendment O
is O
not O
made O
retrospective O
by O
express O
words O
or O
necessary O
intendment. O
The O
fact O
that O
the O
pre-existing O
right O
of O
appeal O
continues O
to O
exist O
must, O
in O
its O
turn, O
necessarily O
imply O
that O
the O
old O
law O
which O
created O
that O
right O
of O
appeal O
must O
also O
exist O
to O
support O
the O
continuation O
of O
that O
right. O
As O
the O
old O
law O
continues O
to O
exist O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
supporting O
the O
pre- O
existing O
right O
of O
appeal O
that O
old O
law O
must O
govern O
the O
exercise O
and O
enforcement O
of O
that O
right O
of O
appeal O
and O
there O
can O
then O
be O
no O
question O
of O
the O
amended O
provision O
preventing O
the O
exercise O
of O
that O
right. O
The O
argument O
that O
the O
authority O
has O
no O
option O
or O
jurisdiction O
to O
admit O
the O
appeal O
unless O
it O
be O
accompanied O
by O
the O
deposit O
of O
the O
assessed O
tax O
as O
required O
by O
the O
amended O
proviso O
to O
section B-PROVISION
22(1) O
of O
the O
Act O
overlooks O
the O
fact O
of O
existence O
of O
the O
old O
law O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
supporting O
the O
pre-existing O
right O
and O
really O
amounts O
to O
begging O
the O
question. O
The O
new O
proviso O
is O
wholly O
inapplicable O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
and O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
authority O
has O
to O
be O
exercised O
under O
the O
old O
law O
which O
so O
continues O
to O
exist. O
The O
argument O
of O
Sri O
Ganapathy O
lyer O
on O
this O
point, O
therefore, O
cannot O
be O
accepted. O
The O
learned O
Advocate O
urges O
that O
the O
requirment O
as O
to O
the O
deposit O
of O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
assessed O
costs O
does O
not O
affect O
the O
right O
of O
appeal O
itself O
which O
still O
remains O
intact, O
but O
only O
introduces O
a O
new O
matter O
of O
procedure. O
A O
provision O
which O
is O
calculated O
to O
deprive O
the O
appellant O
of O
the O
unfettered O
right O
of O
appeal O
cannot O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
mere O
alteration O
in O
procedure. O
Indeed O
the O
new O
requirement O
cannot O
be O
said O
merely O
to O
regulate O
the O
exercise O
of O
the O
appellants O
pre-existing O
right O
but O
in O
truth O
whittles O
down O
the O
right O
itself O
and O
cannot O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
mere O
rule O
of O
procedure. O
Finally, O
Sri O
Ganapathy O
lyer O
faintly O
urges O
that O
until O
actual O
assessment O
there O
can O
be O
no O
lis O
and, O
therefore, O
no O
right O
of O
appeal O
can O
accrue O
before O
that O
event. O
There O
are O
two O
answers O
to O
this O
plea. O
Whenever O
there O
is O
a O
proposition O
by O
one O
party O
and O
an O
opposition O
to O
that O
proposition O
by O
another O
a O
lis O
arises. O
It O
may O
be O
conceded, O
though O
not O
deciding O
it, O
that O
when O
the O
assessee O
files O
his O
return O
a O
lis O
may O
not O
immediately O
arise, O
for O
under O
section B-PROVISION
11 I-PROVISION
(1) O
the O
authority O
may O
accept O
the O
return O
as O
correct O
and O
complete. O
But O
if O
the O
authority O
is O
not O
satisfied O
as O
to O
the O
correctness O
of O
the O
return O
and O
calls O
for O
evidence, O
surely O
a O
controversy O
arises O
involving O
a O
proposition O
by O
the O
assessee O
and O
an O
opposition O
by O
the O
State. O
The O
circumstance O
that O
the O
authority O
who O
raises O
the O
dispute O
is O
himself O
the O
judge O
can O
make O
no O
difference, O
for O
the O
authority O
raises O
the O
dispute O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
State O
and O
in O
so O
acting O
only O
represents O
the O
State. O
It O
1000 O
will O
appear O
from O
the O
dates O
given O
above O
that O
in O
this O
case O
the O
lis O
in O
the O
sense O
explained O
above O
arose O
before O
the O
date O
of O
amendment O
of O
the O
section. O
Further, O
even O
if O
the O
lis O
is O
to O
be O
taken O
as O
arising O
only O
on O
the O
date O
of O
assessment, O
there O
was O
a O
possibility O
of O
such O
a O
lis O
arising O
as O
soon O
as O
proceedings O
started O
with O
the O
filing O
of O
the O
return O
or, O
at O
any O
rate, O
when O
the O
authority O
called O
for O
evidence O
and O
started O
the O
hearing O
and O
the O
right O
of O
appeal O
must O
be O
taken O
to O
have O
been O
in O
existence O
even O
at O
those O
dates. O
For O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
accrual O
of O
the O
right O
of O
appeal O
the O
critical O
and O
relevant O
date O
is O
the O
date O
of O
initiation O
of O
the O
proceedings O
and O
not O
the O
decision O
itself. O

This O
is O
an O
appeal O
by O
an O
assessee O
against O
a O
judgment O
and O
order O
of O
the O
High O
Court O
at O
Bombay O
delivered O
on O
a O
reference O
made O
by O
the O
Income-tax O
Appellate O
Tribunal. O
The O
Bombay O
High O
Court O
refused O
leave O
to O
appeal O
but O
the O
assessee O
obtained O
special O
leave O
from O
this O
Court. O
The O
appellant O
deals O
in O
silver O
and O
shares O
and O
a O
substantial O
part O
of O
his O
holding O
is O
kept O
in O
silver O
bullion O
and O
shares. O
His O
business O
is O
run O
and O
owned O
by O
himself. O
His O
accounts O
are O
maintained O
according O
to O
the O
mercantile O
system. O
It O
is O
admitted O
that O
under O
this O
system O
stocks O
can O
be O
valued O
in O
one O
of O
two O
ways O
and O
provided O
there O
is O
no O
variation O
in O
the O
method O
from O
year O
to O
year O
without O
the O
sanction O
of O
the O
Income-tax O
authorities O
an O
assessee O
can O
choose O
whichever O
method, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
the O
cost O
price O
of O
the O
stock O
was O
wnterred O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
and O
not O
its O
market O
value O
and O
similarly O
the O
cost O
price O
was O
again O
entered O
at O
the O
close O
of O
the O
year O
of O
any O
stock O
which O
was O
not O
disposed O
of O
during O
the O
yeaar. O
The O
question O
referred O
were O
- O
Whether O
in O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
case O
any O
income O
arose O
to O
the O
assessee O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
transfer O
of O
hsres O
and O
silver O
bars O
to O
the O
trustees? O
If O
the O
answer O
to O
question O
(I) O
is O
in O
afirmative, O
whether O
the O
method O
employed O
by O
the O
Appellate B-ORG
Assistant I-ORG
Commissioner O
and O
upheld O
by O
the O
Appellate O
Tribunal O
in O
computing O
the O
assessees O
income O
from O
the O
transfer O
is O
the O
proper O
method O
for O
computing O
the O
income? O
Our O
answer O
to O
the O
first O
question O
is O
that O
in O
the O
circumstances O
of O
this O
case O
no O
income O
arose O
to O
the O
appellant O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
transfer O
of O
the O
shares O
and O
silver O
bars O
to O
the O
trustees. O
In O
view O
of O
that, O
the O
second O
question O
does O
not O
arise. O
The O
appeal O
is O
allowed O
with O
costs. O
In O
my O
opinion O
the O
manner O
of O
his O
dealing O
with O
the O
asset O
after O
he O
withdraws O
it O
from O
the O
stock-in-trade O
of O
the O
business O
is O
really O
immmaterial. O
What O
is O
material O
from O
the O
stock-in-trade O
of O
the O
business O
and O
that O
vlaue O
can O
only O
be O
determine O
by O
the O
market O
value O
of O
the O
asset O
as O
at O
the O
date O
of O
its O
withdrawal. O
With O
great O
respect O
to O
the O
learned O
Judges O
I O
do O
not O
see O
my O
way O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
reasoning O
of O
this O
judgment O
does O
not O
take O
count O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
at O
the O
date O
of O
the O
partition O
the O
assets O
which O
had O
been O
brought O
into O
the O
business O
at O
the O
earlier O
dates O
had O
depreciated O
in O
value O
and O
it O
was O
these O
depreciated O
assets O
which O
were O
the O
subject-matter O
of O
partition O
between O
the O
partners. O
Even O
if O
the O
partition O
be O
not O
treated O
as O
a O
sale O
it O
was O
a O
transer O
of O
property, O
the O
property O
of O
the O
firm O
being O
transferred O
to O
the O
individual O
partners O
thereof O
and O
each O
partner O
obtaining O
an O
absolute O
interest O
in O
the O
shares O
thus O
transferred O
to O
him O
by O
the O
firm O
was O
concerned O
it O
was O
certainly O
a O
transfer O
of O
the O
property O
to O
the O
individual O
partners O
and O
even O
as O
regards O
the O
partners O
themselves O
it O
was O
transfer O
of O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
partners O
inter O
se O
in O
the O
shares O
respectively O
transferred O
absolutely O
to O
each O
of O
them. O
If O
it O
were O
necessary O
to O
do O
so O
I O
would O
certainly O
say O
that O
the O
case O
was O
erroneously O
decided. O

of O
the O
appellant O
was O
a O
question O
of O
law O

the O

profits O

in O
the O

a O

of O
this O
court O
in O
the O

We O
are O
at O

not O

to O
express O
any O
opinion O
on O
the O
merits O
of O
this O
contention. O
Suffice O
it O
to O
say O
that O
this O
contention O
raises O
a O
question O
of O
law O
which O
should O
have O
been O
referred O
to O
the O
High O
Court O
by O
the O
Income-tax O
Appellate O
Tribunal O
for O
its O
decision, O
and O
when O
on O
the O
refusal O
of O
the O

Tribunal O
to O

a O
case O
and O
to O
refer O
the O
said O
question O
to O
the O
High O
Court O
the O
appellant O
approached O
the O
High O
Court, O
the O
High O
Court O
should, O
in O
the O
exercise O
of O
its O
jurisdiction O
under O
section B-PROVISION
66(2) O
of O
the O
Income-tax O
Act, O
have O
asked O
the O
Income-tax O
Appellate O
Tribunal O
to O
state O
a O
case O
and O
refer O
the O
said O
question O
to O
it O
for O
its O
decision. O
The O
question O
as O
it O
has O
been O
framed O
is O
not O
aptly O
worded. O

The O
brief O
facts O
necessary O
for O
present O
purposes O
are O
that O
the O
appellant O
was O
appointed O
as O
a O
foot- O
constable O
in O
1931 O
in O
the O
Punjab O
Police O
and O
was O
dismissed O
on O
January O
25, O
1944. O
Shortly O
before, O
he O
was O
acting O
as O
an O
Assistant O
Sub-Inspector O
and O
actually O
working O
as O
a O
Police O
Censor. O
The O
charge O
against O
him O
was O
that O
while O
he O
was O
working O
as O
Police O
Censor, O
he O
detained O
certain O
letters O
illegally O
and O
had O
copies O
and O
photo- O
graphs O
made O
of O
them O
and O
later O
used O
these O
copies O
and O
photographs O
for O
blackmail. O
He O
was O
consequently O
reverted O
to O
his O
substantive O
post O
of O
head O
constable O
on O
January O
14, O
1944. O
Thereafter O
on O
January O
21, O
1944, O
an O
enquiry O
was O
started O
against O
him O
by O
the O
Superintendent O
of O
Police O
and O
he O
was O
eventually O
dismissed. O
He O
went O
in O
appeal O
to O
the O
Deputy O
Inspector O
General O
of O
Police, O
which O
was O
dismissed. O
He O
then O
went O
in O
revision O
to O
the O
Inspector O
General O
of O
Police, O
which O
also O
failed. O
Section O
243 O
however O
is O
in O
these O
terms- O
Notwithstanding O
anything O
in O
the O
foregoing O
provisions O
of O
this O
chapter, O
the O
conditions O
of O
service O
of O
the O
subordinate O
ranks O
of O
the O
various O
police O
forces O
in O
India O
shall O
be O
such O
as O
may O
be O
determined O
by O
or O
under O
the O
Act O
relating O
to O
those O
forces O
respectively. O
Obviously O
s. O
243 O
was O
a O
special O
provision O
with O
regard O
to O
subordinate O
ranks O
of O
police O
forces O
in O
India O
and O
it O
is O
not O
in O
dispute O
that O
the O
appellant O
belonged O
to O
the O
subordinate O
ranks. O
Therefore O
according O
to O
s. O
243, O
the O
conditions O
of O
service O
of O
the O
subordinate O
ranks O
are O
governed O
by O
or O
under O
the O
Acts O
relating O
to O
police O
forces O
and O
s. O
240(3) O
can O
have O
no O
application O
to O
them. O
The O
non O
obstante O
clause O
of O
s. O
243 O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
so O
far O
as O
the O
subordinate O
ranks O
of O
police O
forces O
in O
India O
are O
concerned, O
a. O
243 O
will O
apply O
and O
not O
the O
earlier O
provisions O
including O
s. O
240(3). O
We O
are O
therefore O
of O
opinion O
that O
in O
view O
of O
the O
special O
provisions O
in O
s. O
243 O
relating O
to O
the O
subordinate O
ranks O
of O
police O
forces O
in O
India O
(to O
which O
the O
appellant O
undoubtedly O
belonged), O
s. O
240(3) O
would O
have O
no O
application. O
We O
may O
in O
this O
connection O
refer O
to O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O
Privy O
Council O
in O
North- O
West B-PRECEDENT

(1), O
where O
it O
was O
held O
that O
the O
non O

clause O
in O
s. O
243 O
excluded O
the O
operation O
of O
s. O
240(2) O
in O
the O
case O
of O
subordinate O
ranks O
of O
police O
forces O
in O
India O

that O
conditions O
of O
service O
included O
the O
right O
of O
dismissal. O

F.C.R. O

That O
case O
dealt O
with O
s. O
240(2) O
but O
the O
same O
reasoning O
would O
in O
our O
opinion O
apply O
to O
s. O
240(3). O
As O
has O
already O
been O
pointed O
out O
by O
the O
learned O
District O
Judge, O
the O
substance O
of O
s. O
240(3) O
was O
brought O
into O
the O
Police O
Regulations O
in O
September O
1946 O
long O
after O
the O
appellant O
had O
been O
dismissed O
and O
would O
therefore O
not O
apply O
to O
the O
appellant. O
He O
would O
therefore O
not O
be O
entitled O
to O
the O
second O
notice O
under O
s. O
240(3) O
as O
explained O

Now O
taking O
the O
last O
contention O
first O
we O
may O
notice O
that O
this O
Court O
in O
Isha O
Marbles O
considered O
the O
scope O
of O
Section O
24 O
of O
the O
Electricity B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
and O
held O
that O
there O
is O
no O
charge O
over O
the O
property O
in O
question O
and O
when O
a O
premises O
comes O
to O
be O
owned O
or O
purchased O
by O
the O
auction O
purchaser O
he O
cannot O
be O
called O

when O
such O
purchaser O
seeks O
supply O
of O
electric O
energy O
or O
it O
is O
made O
clear O
in O
that O
decision O
that O
what O
matters O
is O
the O
contract O
entered O
into O
by O
the O
erstwhile O
consumer O
with O
the O
Board O
and O
the O
Board O
cannot O
seek O
the O
enforcement O
of O
contractual O
liability O
against O
the O
third O
party. O
Therefore O
this O
decision O
in O
Isha O
Marbles O
cannot O
be O
taken O
advantage O
of O
by O
the O
appellant O
at O
all O
in O
this O
case. O
In O
this O
case O
the O
liability O
arises O
under O
the O
Central B-STATUTE
Excise I-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
and O
Rule O
230 O
2 O
of O
the O
Central B-STATUTE
Excise I-STATUTE
Rules. O
The O
said O
Rule O
clearly O
indicates O
that O
it O
is O
a O
mode O
of O
recovery O
of O
the O
excise O
dues O
from O
the O
assets O
owned O
by O
a O
predecessor O
and O
on O
his O
liabilities O
being O
assessed O
could O
be O
recovered O
even O
from O
the O
successor. O
The O
argument O
advanced O
by O
the O
appellant O
that O
sale O
having O
taken O
place O
under O
the O
State B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
free O
of O
encumbrances O
and O
the O
transferor O
s O
rights O
or O

cannot O
be O
that O
of O
transferee O
does O
not O
hold O
good. O
Section O
29 O
2 O
of O
the O
State B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
property O
pledged O
mortgaged O
hypothecated O
or O
assigned O
to O
the O
Financial B-ORG
Corporation I-ORG
can O
be O
brought O
to O

such O
a O

When O

the O
argument O
that O

is O
a O
special O

the O

would O
prevail O
over O

Each O

1,35,000/- O

against O
the O
New B-ORG

of O

It O
is O
not O
necessary O
in O
this O
appeal O
to O
consider O
whether O
because O
of O
an O
agreement O
to O
pay O
interest O
the O
relationship O
may O
be O
deemed O
to O
be O
of O
debtor O
and O
creditor, O
because O
it O
was O
held O
by O
both O
the O
courts O
below O
that O
no O
such O
agreement O
is O
proved, O
and O
according O
to O
the O
settled O
practice O
of O
this O
court O
the O
finding O
is O
regarded O
a O
binding. O
The B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
charged O
no O
commission O
or O
remuneration O
for O
transmitting O
the O
amount O
to O
Calcutta, O
but O
that, O
in O
our O
judgment, O
is O
a O
circumstance O
which O
permits O
of O
no O
inference O
against O
the O
plaintiff. O
Undoubtedly, O
when O
the O
amount O
was O
delivered O
to O
the O
Bank O
by O
the O
plaintiff O
it O
was O
his O
intention O
to O
open O
fixed O
deposit O
account O
in O
Calcutta O
with O
the O
Banks O
branch O
but O
the O
fixed O
deposit O
accounts O
were O
to O
be O
opened O
after O
instructions O
were O
received. O
The O
transaction, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
two O
receipts, O
was O
primarily O
one O
of O
entrustment O
of O
the O
amount O
to O
the O
Bank O
for O
transmission O
to O
Calcutta. O
After O
the O
purpose O
for O
which O
the O
moneys O
were O
entrusted O
was O
carried O
out, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
further O
instructions O
the O
defendant O
did O
not O
cease O
to O
be O
a O
trustee. O
So O
long O
as O
instructions O
were O
not O
given O
by O
the O
plaintiff O
for O
appropriation O
of O
the O
amounts O
the O
Bank O
continued O
to O
hold O
the O
amounts O
transmitted O
for O
and O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
and O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
gave O
instructions O
or O
acquiesced O
in O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
fixed O
deposit O
account O
after O
the O
same O
reached O
Calcutta. O
It O
is O
immaterial O
that O
the O
Bank O
purported O
to O
open O
fixed O
deposit O
account O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
with O
the O
amounts O
received O
at O
its O
head O
office O
at O
Lahore. O
That O
course O
of O
action O
was O
adopted O
without O
the O
consent O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
and O
it O
could O
not O
bind O
the O
plaintiff. O
The O
High O
Court O
was, O
therefore, O
right O
in O
holding O
that O
the O
amount O
delivered O
by O
the O
plaintiff O
to O
the O
Bank O
at O
Lahore O
remained O
in O
trust O
even O
after O
it O
reached O
Calcutta, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
held O
by O
the O
Bank, O
in O
deposit O
for O
the O
plaintiff O

in O
which O
the O
section O
occurs O
is O
directed O
at O
regulating O
the O
hours O
of O
employment O
of O
persons O
who O
are O
employed O
in O
the O
business O
of O
shops O
or O
commercial O
establish- O
ments. O
Therefore, O
in O
so O
far O
as O
section B-PROVISION
7 I-PROVISION
covers O
establish- O
ments O
where O
labour O
is O
employed, O
it O
is O
undoubtedly O
intra O
vires. O
But O
it O
was O
argued O
that O
the O
section O
can O
have O
no O
appli- O
cation O
to O
shops O
which O
an O
owner O
runs O
with O
or O
without O
the O
assistance O
of O
his O
family. O
Reliance O
for O
this O
was O
placed O
on O
section B-PROVISION
2-A I-PROVISION
(i) O
and O
(j) O
which O
is O
as O
follows O
2-A. O
Nothing O
in O
this O
Act O
shall O
apply O
to-- O
persons O
employed O
in O
a O
managerial O
capacity O
and O
(j) O
the O
members O
of O
the O
family O
of O
the O
employer. O
It O
was O
argued O
that O
the O
sale O
was O
by O
the O
son. O
He O
is O
not O
affected O
by O
the O
Act. O
Therefore. O
he O
was O
entitled O
to O
sell O
and O
he O
could O
not O
sell O
unless O
the O
shop O
was O
kept O
open O
to O
enable O
him O
to O
do O
so. O
So O
also O
as O
regards O
the O
appel- O
lant, O
the O
owner, O
who O
was O
there O
in O
a O
managerial O
capacity. O
In O
our O
opinion, O
this O
is O
fallacious O
because O
the O
conviction O
here O
is O
not O
for O
the O
sale O
but O
for O
keeping O
the O
shop O
open O
on O
a O
close O
day. O
Section O
2-A O
(j) O
does O
not O
give O
the O
son O
a O
right O
to O
keep O
the O
shop O
open O
or, O
for O
that O
matter, O
a O
right O
to O
sell. O
All O
it O
says O
is O
that O
he, O
being O
a O
member O
of O
the O
family, O
shall O
not O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
provisions O
of O
the O
Act. O
Section O
7(1), O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
is O
directed O
against O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
shop, O
not O
against O
his O
family. O
It O
compels O
the O
owner O
to O
keep O
his O
shop O
closed O
one O
day O
in O
a O
week. O
It O
was O
then O
contended O
that O
if O
a O
person O
employed O
in O
a O
managerial O
capacity O
cannot O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
Act, O
then O
the O
appellant O
who O
was O
there O
in O
that O
capacity O
cannot O
be O
compelled O
to O
close O
the O
shop O
under O
section B-PROVISION
7. O
This O
is O
also O
fallacious. O
It O
happens O
in O
the O
present O
case O
that O
the O
owner O
and O
the O
manag- O
er O
are O
the O
same O
but O
the O
Act O
obviously O
makes O
provision O
for O
a O
class O
of O
case O
in O
which O
they O
are O
different. O
The O
owner O
is O
obliged O
to O
close O
the O
shop O
one O
day O
in O
a O
week, O
though O
the O
manager O
of O
the O
shop O
can O
work O
without, O
for O
example, O
having O
the O
twenty-four O
consecutive O
hours O
of O
rest O
every O
week O
which O
section B-PROVISION
7-A I-PROVISION
enjoins. O
The O
appellants O
capacity O
as O
manager O
will O
have O
to O
be O
separated O
from O
his O
character O
as O
owner O
for O
this O
purpose. O
Section O
2-A(i) O
does O
not O
control O
section B-PROVISION
7 I-PROVISION
(1). O
Lastly, O
it O
was O
argued O
that O
the O
scheme O
of O
the O
Act O
makes O
it O
plain O
that O
it O
is O
for O
ameliorating O
the O
conditions O
of O
labour O
employed O
in O
shops. O
It O
cannot O
therefore O
apply O
to O
shops O
in O
which O
no O
labour O
is O
employed, O
particularly O
when O
the O
family O
of O
the O
employer O
is O
expressly O
excluded O
from O
the O
purview O
of O
the O
Act. O
For O
this O
reason O
also, O
it O
cannot O
fall O
under O
item O
27 O
in O
List O
III. O
We O
are O
of O
opinion O
that O
such O
a O
narrow O
interpre- O
tation O
cannot O
be O
placed O
upon O
the O
entry. O
The O
legislature O
may O
have O
felt O
it O
necessary, O
in O
order O
to O
reduce O
the O
possibilities O
of O
evasion O
to O
a O
minimum, O
to O
encroach O
upon O
the O
liberties O
of O
those O
who O
would O
not O
otherwise O
have O
been O
affected. O
That O
we O
think O
it O
had O
power O
to O
do. O

The O
award O
made O
by O
the O
Industrial O
Tribunal, O
Bombay, O
in O
Reference O
(IT) O
No. O
75 O
of O
1956 O
between O
the O
appellant O
and O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
whereby O
the O
Industrial O
Tribunal O
awarded O
to O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
4 O
1/2 O
months O
basic O
wages O
as O
bonus O
for O
the O
year O
1954-55 O
(year O
ending O
June O
30, O
1955). O
The O
appellant O
is O
a O
subsidiary O
of O
the O
Premier O
Construction O
Co., O
Ltd., O
and O
manufactures O
Hume O
Pipes. O
It O
was O
therefore O
contended O
that O
the O
calculations O
should O
be O
made O
after O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
savings O
thus O
effected O
by O
the O
appellant O
and O
only O
a O
sum O
of O
Rs. O
1,23,138 O
- O
which O
was O
the O
actual O
sum O
paid O
to O
those O
workmen O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
and O
no O
more. O
We O
are O
afraid, O
we O
cannot O
accept O
this O
contention. O
If O
this O
contention O
was O
accepted O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
before O
us O
would O
have O
an O
advantage O
over O
those O
workmen O
with O
whom O
settlements O
have O
been O
made O
and O
would O
get O
larger O
amounts O
by O
way O
of O
bonus O
merely O
by O
reason O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
appellant O
had O
managed O
to O
settle O
the O
claims O
of O
those O
workmen O
at O
lesser O
figures. O
If O
this O
contention O
of O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
was O
pushed O
to O
its O
logical O
extent O
it O
would O
also O
mean O
that O
in O
the O
event O
of O
the O
non-fulfilment O
of O
the O
conditions O
imposed O
by O
the O
Tribunal O
in O
the O
award O
of O
bonus O
herein O
bringing O
in O
savings O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
appellant, O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
would O
be O
entitled O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
those O
savings O
also O
and O
should O
be O
awarded O
larger O
amounts O
by O
way O
of O
bonus, O
which O
would O
really O
be O
the O
result O
of O
the O
claimants O
entitled O
to O
the O
same O
not O
receiving O
it O
under O
certain O
circumstances-an O
event O
which O
would O
be O
purely O
an O
extraneous O
one O
and O
unconnected O
with O
the O
contribution O
of O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
towards O
the O
gross O
profits O
earned O
by O
the O
appellant. O
The O
Tribunal O
was, O
therefore, O
right O
in O
calculating O
the O
bonus O
on O
an O
All-India O
basis. O
By O
our O
order O
dated O
April O
12, O
1957, O
the O
appellant O
was O
ordered O
to O
pay O
to O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
within O
a O
fortnight O
from O
the O
date O
thereof O
bonus O
for O
the O
year O
1954-55 O
equivalent O
to O
two O
months O
basic O
wages O
that O
amount O
has O
already O
been O
paid O
and O
works O
out O
at O
Rs. O
3.39 O
lacs O
on O
an O
All-India O
basis. O
The O
only O
question O
which O
therefore O
survives O
is O
what O
further O
bonus, O
if O
any, O
would O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
be O
entitled O
to O
from O
the O
distributable O
surplus O
of O
Rs. O
12 O
lacs. O
The O
sum O
of O
Rs. O
3.50 O
lacs O
required O
for O
building O
up O
the O
debenture O
redemption O
reserve O
is O
an O
all-engrossing O
need O
of O
the O
appellant O
and O
that O
is O
a O
factor O
which O
must O
of O
necessity O
be O
taken O
into O
consideration O
while O
arriving O
at O
the O
ultimate O
figure, O
particularly O
because O
such O
redemption O
of O
the O
debentures O
would O
enure O
not O
only O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
Company O
and O
its O
shareholders O
but O
also O
of O
the O
workmen O
employed O
therein. O
Having O
regard O
to O
all O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
case, O
we O
feel O
that O
an O
award O
of O
four O
months O
basic O
wages O
as O
aggregate O
bonus O
for O
the O
year O
1954-55 O
(which O
by O
the O
way O
was O
the O
bonus O
awarded O
for O
the O
previous O
year O
1953-54 O
also) O
would O
give O
a O
fair O
share O
to O
the O
labour O
in O
the O
distributable O
surplus, O
leaving O
to O
the O
shareholders O
and O
the O
company O
a O
balance O
of O
Rs. O
5.22 O
lacs O
to O
be O
utilised O
by O
them O
not O
only O
towards O
building O
up O
of O
the O
debenture O
redemption O
reserve O
but O
also O
for O
building O
up O
other O
reserves, O
which O
would O
be O
utilised O
for O
various O
other O
purposes O
indicated O
above. O

Only O
one O
question O
arises O
for O
consideration O
in O
this O
appeal O
by O
special O
leave O
and O
that O
is O
the O
meaning O
to O
be O
given O
to O
the O
expression O
final O
decision O
occurring O
in O
the O
first O
proviso O
to O

A O
of O
the O
Provincial B-STATUTE
Insolvency I-STATUTE
Act, I-STATUTE

(Act O
No. O
5 O
of O
1920), O
introduced O
by O
Act O
No. O
25 O
of O
1948. O
For O
appreciating O
the O
argument O
advanced O
before O
us O
a O
few O
facts O
have O
to O
be O
stated. O
Venkata O
Reddy, O
the O
father O
of O
the O
appellants, O
was O
adjudicated O
an O
insolvent O
by O
the O
Sub-Court, O
Salem O
in O
I. O
P. O
No. O
73 O
of O
1935. O
At O
that O
time O
only O
the O
appellants O
1 O
and O
2 O
were O
born O
while O
the O
third O
appellant O
was O
born O
later. O
The O
fathers O
one-third O
share O
was O
put O
up O
for O
auction O
by O
the O
Official O
Receiver O
and O
was O
purchased O
by O
one O
Karuppan O
Pillai O
for O
Rs. O
80/-. O
The O
Official O
Receiver O
then O
put O
up O
for O
auction O
the O
two-thirds O
share O
belonging O
to O
appellants O
1 O
and O
2 O
on O
July O
27, O
1936, O
which O
was O
purchased O
by O
the O
same O
person O
for O
Rs. O
341/-. O
He O
sold O
the O
entire O
property O
to O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
Pethi O
Reddy O
on O
May O
25, O
1939, O
for O
Rs. O
300/-. O
The O
appellants O
instituted O
a O
suit O
on O
February O
1, O
1.943, O
for O
the O
partition O
of O
the O
joint O
family O
property O
to O
which O
suit O
they O
made O
Pethi O
Reddy O
a O
party O
and O
claimed O
thereunder O
two- O
thirds O
share O
in O
the O
property O
puchased O
by O
him. O
In O
that O
suit O
it O
was O
contended O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
that O
on O
their O
fathers O
insolvency O
the O
share O
of O
the O
appellants O
in O
the O
joint O
family O
property O
also O
vested O
in O
the O
Official O
Receiver O
and O
that O
he O
had O
the O
power O
to O
sell O
it. O
The O
contention O
was O
negatived O
by O
the O
trial O
court O
which O
passed O
a O
preliminary O
decree O
for O
partition O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
appellants. O
In O
the O
case O
before O
us O
the O
preliminary O
decree O
was O
never O
challenged O
at O
all O
by O
preferring O
any O
appeal O
and O
therefore, O
the O
matters O
conclude O
by O
it O
are O
not O
open O
to O
challenge O
in O
an O
appeal O
against O
the O
final O
decree. O
Further, O
a O
preliminary O
decree O
cannot O
be O
equated O
with O
an O
interlocutory O
order O
within O
the O
meaning O
of O
s. O
105, O
Code O
of O
Civil O
Procedure. O
It O
will O
thus O
be O
seen O
that O
the O
decision O
relied O
upon O
has O
no O
application O
to O
the O
facts O
of O
this O
case. O
Our O
conclusion, O
therefore, O
is O
that O
in O
this O
case O
the O
sale O
made O
by O
the O
Official O
Receiver O
during O
the O
insolvency O
of O
the O
appellants O
father O
was O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
final O
decision O
by O
a O
competent O
court O
inasmuch O
as O
that O
court O
decided O
that O
the O
sale O
was O
of O
no O
avail O
to O
the O
purchaser O
at O
the O
Official O
Receiver O
had O
no O
power O
to O
effect O
that O
sale. O
Nothing O
more O
was O
required O
to O
be O
established O
by O
the O
appellants O
before O
being O
entitled O
to O
the O
protection O
of O
the O
first O
proviso O
to O
s.28A. O
Since O
they O
have O
established O
what O
was O
required O
to O
be O
established O
by O
them, O
they O
are O
entitled O
to O
a O
final O
decree O
and O
the O
High O
Court O
was O
in O
error O
in O
dismissing O
their O
application O
in O
that O
behalf. O
In O
the O
result O
we O
allow O
the O
appeal, O
set O
aside O
the O
judgment O
and O
decree O
of O
the O
High O
Court O
and O
restore O
that O
of O
the O
trial O
court O
as O
affirmed O
in O
appeal O
by O
the O
learned O
Subordinate O
judge. O
Costs O
in O
this O
court O
and O
in O
the O
High O
Court O
will O
be O
borne O
by O
the O
present O
respondent. O

In O
those O
circumstances O
the O
remainder O
was O
sublet O
for O
fourteen O
years O
at O
an O
annual O
rent O
of O
pound O
1,150. O
The O
general O
commissioners O
of O

decided O

Scott O
L.J. O
in O
delivering O
his O
judgment O
laid O
emphasis O
on O
the O
point O
that O
after O
the O
business O
of O
the O
company O
had O
dwindled, O
it O
partitioned O
part O
of O
the O
land O
from O
the O
rest O
and O
sublet O
it O
by O
installing O
a O
heating O
apparatus O
for O
the O
sub-lessee. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
war O
conditions O
had O
reduced O
the O
companys O
business O
to O
very O
small O
proportions O
and O
they O
cut O
their O
loss O
by O
going O
out O
of O
business O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
major O
part O
of O
their O
land O
and O
put O
it O
out O
of O
their O
power O
for O
14 O
years O
to O
resume O
business O
there. O
In O
this O
situation O
it O
was O
observed O
that O
in O
that O
case O
they O
were O
dealing O
with O
part O
of O
the O
property O
of O
the O
company O
which O
had O
come O
redundant O
and O
was O
sublet O
purely O
to O
produce O
income--a O
transaction. O
quite O
apart O
from O
the O
ordinary O
business O
activities O
of O
the O
company. O
It O
was O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
question O
whether O
a O
particular O
source O
of O
income O
was O
income O
or O
not O
must O
be O
decided, O
as O
it O
could O
be, O
according O
to O
ordinary O
commonsense O
principles. O
The O
short O
question O
to O
decide O
in O
this O
case O
is O
whether O
on O
the O
facts O
found, O
it O
could O
be O

the O

had O
become O
redundant O
for O
its O

as O
a O
silk O

concern, O
simply O
by O
the O
circumstance O
that O
for O

it O
could O
not O
be O
used O
by O
it O
personally O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
dyeing O
silk O
yarn O
owing O
to O
the O
non-availability O

It O
is O

that O
the O
company O
would O
not O

as O
soon O

Instead O
of O
dyeing O
yarn, O
another O

Unfortunately O
the O
learned O
Single O
Judge O

the O
Division O

the O
High O

failed O
to O
take O
cognizance O

that O

brought O

i.e O
the O
Chief O
Invigilator O
from O

and O
opened O

the O

The O
High O

also O
did O
not O
pay O
due O
weightage O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

had O
not O
handled O
the O

any O
stage O
and O
he O
had O
no O

These O
errors O
and O
omissions O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
learned O
Single O
Judge O
and O
the O
Division O

in O
our O
considered O
view O
are O
fatal O
to O
their O
concurrence O

the O
finding O
recorded O
by O
the O
Enquiry O
Officer O
the O
Secretary O

as O
Invigilator O
on O
17.2.1990 O
and O
18.2.1990. O
At O
the O
cost O
of O
repetition O
it O
deserves O
to O
be O
mentioned O
that O
the O
appellant O
had O
no O

in O
the O
matter O
of O
mixing O
of O
the O

Before O

no O

produced O
by O
the O
Commission O
to O
prove O
that O
the O
appellant O
had O
the O

before O

Inspector B-ORG
Crime I-ORG

clearly O
show O
that O

the O

N. O
bakshi O
was O
admitted O
in O

to O

Indian O
Civil O
Service O
and O
was, O
after O
his O
arrival O
in O

posted O
in O
the O
Province O
of O

He O
continued O
to O
serve O
in O
the O
State O
of O
Bihar O
after O
independence. O
On O
February O
3, O
1956, O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
enquired O
of O
the O
Accountant O
General O
of O
Bihar O
about O
the O
number O
of O
passages O
to O
which O
he O
and O
the O
members O
of O
his O
family O
were O
entitled O
under O
the O
Superior O
Civil O
Services O
(Revision O
of O
Pay O
and O
Pension) O
Rules, O
1924-hereinafter O
called O
the O
Statutory B-STATUTE
Rules. O
Consequently, O
I O
think O
if O
a O
person O
was O
in O
receipt O
of O
a O
Payment, O
or O
in O
receipt O
of O
a O
percentage, O
or O
any O
kind O
of O
payment O
which O
would O
not O
be O
actual O
money O
payment, O
the O
amount O
he O
would O
receive O
annually O
in O
respect O
of O
this O
would O
be O
remuneration. O
The O
expression O
remuneration O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
used O
in O
the O
Constitution O
in O
this O
wide O
connotation. O
As O
already O
observed, O
the O
right O
to O
passage O
was O
originally O
made O
part O
of O
the O
salary, O
but O
under O
the O
Rules O
framed O
in O
1926, O
the O
provision O
for O
setting O
apart O
a O
fixed O
sum O
of O
money O
as O
salary O
out O
of O
the O
General O
Passage O
Fund O
was O
altered O
and O
passages O
were O
credited O
to O
the O
account O
of O
members O
of O
Civil O
services O
and O
debited O
and O
when O
they O
were O
availed O
of O
out O
of O
the O
general O
Revenue O
of O
the O
State. O
This O
alteration O
was O
made O
merely O
for O
administrative O
convenience O
and O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
character O
of O
the O
benefit. O
Under O
the O
Rules O
of O
1924, O
the O
provision O
for O
passage O
port O
of O
the O
remuneration O
and O
it O
continued O
to O
be O
such O
even O
after O
the O
amendment O
of O
the O
Rules O
in O
1926 O
The O
right O
to O
passage O
benefits O
was O
statutory, O
and O
was O
under O
the O
Indian B-STATUTE
Independence I-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
in O
the O
nature O
of O
an O
allowance, O
or O
in O
any O
event O
privilege O
or O
facility O
paid O
in O
kind. O
It O
was O
expressly O
made O
part O
of O
the O
remuneration O
earned O
by O
the O
numbers O
of O
the O
Indian O
Civil O
Service. O
The O
Conditions O
of O
service O
as O
to O
remuneration O
having O
been O
guaranteed, O
the O
right O
to O
this O
benefit O
remained O
guaranteed O
to O
those O
members O
of O
the O
Indian O
Civil O
Service O
who O
were O
entitled O
to O
it O
before O
the O
Constitutions. O
This O
guarantee O
which O
was O
continued O
in O
force O
even O
after O
the O
Commencement O
of O
the O
Constitution O
was O
for O
the O
first O
time O
by O
Rules O
made O
in O
June O
1957 O
by O
retrospective O
amendment O
of O
the O
Statutory B-STATUTE
Rules I-STATUTE
from O
July O
12, O
1956 O
sought O
to O
be O
cancelled. O
But O
the O
central O
Government O
in O
exercise O
of O
Rule O
making O
power O
was O
incompetent O
to O
destroy O
or O
cancel O
a O
constitutional O
guarantee. O

The O
suit O
was O
filed O
by O
the O
present O
appellants O
for O
a O
declaration O
of O
their O
title O
to O
136 O
odd O
bighas O
of O
Ryotikasht O
lands O
and O
for O
possession O
thereof O
either O
exclusively O
or O
jointly O
with O
the O
defendants. O
A O
claim O
for O
mesne O
profits O
and O
interest O
was O
also O
made. O
The O
suit O
was O
decreed O
by O
the O
Subordinate O
Judge, O
Motihari, O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
the O
defendants O
were O
in O
possession O
of O
the O
suit O
lands O
as O
benamidars. O
The O
correct O
position O
in O
law, O
in O
our O
opinion, O
is O
that O
what O
one O
has O
to O
see O
is O
whether O
the O
illegality O
goes O
so O
much O
to O
the O
root O
of O
the O
matter O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
cannot O
bring O
his O
action O
without O
relying O
upon O
the O
illegal O
transaction O
into O
which O
he O
had O
entered. O
If O
the O
illegality O
be O
trivial O
or O
venial, O
as O
stated O
by O
Williston O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
is O
not O
required O
to O
rest O
his O
case O
upon O
that O
illegality, O
then O
public O
policy O
demands O
that O
the O
defendant O
should O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
position. O
A O
strict O
view, O
of O
course, O
must O
be O
taken O
of O
the O
plaintiffs O
conduct, O
and O
he O
should O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
circumvent O
the O
illegality O
by O
resorting O
to O
some O
subterfuge O
or O
by O
mis-stating O
the O
facts. O
If, O
however, O
the O
matters O
is O
clear O
and O
the O
illegality O
is O
not O
required O
to O
be O
pleaded O
or O
proved O
as O
part O
of O
the O
cause O
of O
action O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
recanted O
before O
the O
illegal O
purpose O
was O
achieved, O
then, O
unless O
it O
be O
of O
such O
a O
gross O
nature O
as O
to O
outrage O
the O
conscience O
of O
the O
Court, O
the O
plea O
of O
the O
defendant O
should O
not O
prevail. O
We O
must O
remember O
that O
benami O
transactions O
are O
common O
in O
India, O
and O
have O
always O
been O
recognised. O
They O
are O
entered O
into O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons, O
and O
the O
benamidar O
holds O
the O
property O
in O
trust O
for O
his O
principal. O
In O
the O
present O
case, O
the O
object O
of O
the O
benami O
transaction O
was O
merely O
to O
keep O
the O
property O
from O
being O
resumed O
by O
the O
Bettiah O
Raj O
on O
the O
expiry O
of O
the O
lease O
in O
favour O
of O
Radhumal, O
which O
undoubtedly O
the O
Bettiah O
Raj O
could O
have O
done, O
if O
it O
had O
been O
so O
minded. O
The O
information O
about O
the O
benami O
transaction O
was, O
however, O
not O
withheld O
from O
the O
Bettiah O
Raj, O
and O
even O
with O
that O
knowledge, O
the O
Bettiah O
Raj O
took O
no O
action O
against O
Radhumal O
or O
the O
benamidars. O
The O
plaintiffs O
recanted O
inasmuch O
as O
they O
asserted O
their O
true O
title O
and O
true O
facts O
before O
the O
occasion O
for O
the O
Raj O
to O
act O
arose. O
Thus, O
the O
fraud, O
though O
intended, O
was O
not O
perpetrated, O
because O
the O
fraud O
could O
only O
be O
effected O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
lease O
term, O
and O
the O
locus O
poenitentiae O
which O
the O
lessee O
possessed O
was O
duly O
used O
long O
before O
the O
expiry O
of O
the O
lease. O
The O
illegality O
was O
also O
of O
a O
trivial O
character, O
inasmuch O
as O
the O
signatures O
of O
Prahlad O
Rai O
and O
others O
were O
made O
on O
the O
relative O
documents O
on O
the O
faith O
of O
their O
close O
friendship O
and O
relationship O
and O
under O
the O
assumption O
that O
no O
objection O
from O
them O
would O
proceed O
to O
the O
making O
of O
the O
application O
on O
their O
behalf O
and O
to O
the O
signing O
of O
the O
B. O
H. O
forms O
in O
their O
names. O
The O
appellants O
were O
not O
required O
to O
prove O
this O
fact O
as O
part O
of O
their O
cause O
of O
action, O
and O
indeed, O
if O
the O
answering O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
are O
to O
be O
believed, O
they O
asserted O
as O
vehemently O
that O
the O
signatures O
were O
not O
forged O
but O
were O
their O
very O
own. O
In O
establishing O
the O
benami O
nature O
of O
a O
transaction, O
the O
cardinal O
point O
to O
be O
proved O
is O
the O
source O
of O
money O
and O
this O
was O
done, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
established O
that O
Prahlad O
Rai O
and O
others O
were O
merely O
farzidars. O
To O
prove O
these O
things, O
it O
did O
not O
require O
the O
proof O
of O
the O
signatures. O

On O
the O
26th B-DATE
July, I-DATE
1958, O
the O
Collector O
of O

passed O
an O

of O
five O

found O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
the O
appellant O
Pukhraj O
and O
imposing O
upon O
him O
a O
personal O
penalty O
of O
Rs. O
25,000/- O

Aggrieved O
by O
the O
said O
order, O
the O
appellant O
filed O
a O
writ O
petition O
in O
the O
High B-COURT
Court I-COURT
of I-COURT
Bombay I-COURT
at O
Nagpur O
under O
Arts. O
226 O
and O
227 O
of O
the O
Constitution O
on O
September O
15, O
1958. O
By O
this O
petition, O
the O
appellant O
claimed O
a O
writ O
of O
Certiorari O
or O
other O
appropriate O
writ O
or O
order O
quashing O
the O
impugned O
order. O
The O
argument O
is O
that O
the O
question O
as O
to O
whether O
there O
was O
a O
reasonable O
belief O
or O
not O
is O
justiceable, O
and O
since O
there O
is O
no O
material O
on O
the O
record O
to O
show O
that O
the O
belief O
could O
have O
been O
reasonable, O
the O
statutory O
presumption O
cannot O
be O
raised. O
In O
our O
opinion, O
this O
argument O
is O
not O
well-founded. O
There O
are O
two O
broad O
features O
of O
this O
seizure O
which O
cannot O
be O
igno- O
red. O
The O
first O
feature O
on O
which O
the O
officer O
relied O
is O
supplied O
by O
the O
quantity O
of O
gold O
in O
question. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
the O
appellant O
was O
carrying O
on O
his O
person O
five O
pieces O
of O
gold O
bullion O
weighing O
as O
much O
as O
290.6 O
tolas. O
This O
large O
quantity O
of O
gold O
valued O
at O
nearly O
Rs. O
30,000/- O
itself O
justified O
a O
reasonable O
belief O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
the O
officer O
that O
the O
gold O
may O
be O
smuggled. O
In O
that O
connection, O
it O
may O
not O
be O
irrelevant O
to O
remember O
that O
the O
said O
officer O
had O
received O
positive O
information O
in O
the O
month O
of O
September, O
1956, O
regarding O
the O
smuggling O
of O
gold O
by O
the O
appellant. O
That O
is O
why O
he O
was O
intercepted O
by O
the O
officer O
on O
the O
25th B-DATE
October, I-DATE
1956, O
at O
the O
Raigarb O
railway O
station O
at O
16.30 O
hours. O
Then O
the O
other O
fact O
on O
which O
the O
reasonable O
belief O
can O
be O
founded O
is O
the O
suspicious O
circumstances O
of O
the O
appellants O
journey. O
The O
appellant O
was O
found O
travelling O
without O
a O
Railway O
ticket O
and O
his O
explanation O
as O
to O
how O
he O
came O
to O
be. O
in O
the O
said O
passenger O
train O
is O
obviously O
untrue. O
A O
person O
carrying O
a, O
large O
quantity O
of O
gold O
and O
found O
travelling O
without O
a O
ticket O
may O
well O
have O
raised O
a O
reasonable O
belief O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
the O
officer O
that O
the O
gold O
was O
smuggled. O
The O
object O
of O
travelling O
without O
a O
ticket O
must O
have O
been O
to O
conceal O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
appellant O
had O
travelled O
all O
the O
way O
from O
Calcutta O
at O
which O
place O
the O
gold O
must O
have O
been O
smuggled. O
The O
story O
subsequently O
mentioned O
by O
the O
appellant O
about O
his O
journey O
to O
Tatanagar O
which O
has O
been O
disbelieved O
brings O
into O
bold O
belief O
the O
purpose O
which O
the O
appellant O
had O
in O
mind O
in O
travelling O
without O
a O
ticket. O
After-all-, O
when O
we O
are O
dealing O
with O
a O
question O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
belief O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
the O
Officer O
who O
effected O
the O
seizure O
was O
reasonable O
or O
not, O
we O
are O
not O
sitting O
in O
appeal O
over O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
said O
officer. O
All O
that O
we O
can O
consider O
is O
whether O
there O
is O
ground O
which O
prima O
facie O
justifies O
the O
said O
reasonable O
belief. O
That O
being O
so, O
we O
do O
not O
think O
there O
is O
any O
substance O
in O
the O
argument O
that O
the O
seizure O
was O
effected O
without O
a O
reasonable O
belief O
and O
so O
is O
outside O
section B-PROVISION

The O
appellants-companies, O
the O
employers, O
in O
these O
sugar O
industries O
also O
challenge O
the O
correctness O
of O
the O
order O
made O
by O
the O
Industrial O
Tribunal O
and O
confirmed O
by O
the O
Labour O
Appellate O

be O

on O
special O
leave O
with O
pay O
for O
the O
period O
of O
such O

As O
regards O
these O
orders O
the O

contend O
that O
they O
run O
counter O
to O
the O
pronouncements O
of O
this O

This O
contention, O
we O
are O

to O
say, O
is O
correct. O
Whatever O
might O

in O

that O
no O

are O

and O
no O
such O

be O

The O
order O
of O
the O

below O
allowing O
travelling O
allowance O
and O
balting O
allowance O
and O
special O
leave O
to O
workmen O
attending O
proceedings O
of O
necessity, O
must O
therefore O
be O
set O
aside. O
Nor O
is O
it O
clear O
from O
the O
materials O
on O
the O
record O
that O
unskilled O
workmen O
employed O
in O
a O
particular O
factory O
consider O
themselves O
attached O
to, O
that O
factory. O
It O
appears O
to O
be O
clear O
that O
once O
the O
season O
is O
over O
the O
unskilled O
workmen O
cease O
to O
have O
any O
contractual O
relations O
with O
the O
employers O
and O
may O
rejoin O
on O
the O
com- O
mencement O
of O
the O
season O
or O
may O
not O
rejoin O
at O
their O
sweet O
will. O
As O
regards O
the O
observations O
of O
the O
Tribunal O
that O
seasonal O
employees O
are O
entitled O
to O
the O
benefit O
of O
provident O
fund, O
gratuity O
and O
also O
bonus O
which O
shows O
that O
in O
fact O
their O
connection O
with O
the O
employers O
is O
not O
broken O
the O
materials O
on O
the O
record O
Are O
too O
scanty O
for O
arriving O
at O
any O
definite O
conclusion. O
In O
consideration O
of O
the O
nature O
and O
extent O
of O
the O
materials O
on O
the O
record O
we O
are O
of O
opinion O
that O
for O
alleviating O
the O
distress O
of O
unskilled O
workmen O
in O
these O
sugar O
factories, O
with O
whom O
we O
are O
concerned O
in O
the O
present O
appeals O
a O
much O
better O
course O
will O
be O
to O
raise O
the O
wage O
structure O
with O
an O
eye O
to O
this O
fact O
that O
for O
a O
part O
of O
the O
off O
season O
at O
least O
when O
they O
remain O
unemployed O
than O
to O
pay O
a O
retaining O
allowance O
for O
the O
entire O
off O
season. O
The O
appellants O
counsel O
readily O
agrees O
that O
the O
fact O
that O
these O
unskilled O
workmen O
find O
employment O
in O
the O
sugar O
factories O
only O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
are O
in O
comparative O
difficulty O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
finding O
employment O
during O
the O
remaining O
months, O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
consideration O
in O
fixing O
their O
wages. O
We O
are O
informed O
that O
a O
Wage O
Board O
entrusted O
with O
the O
task O
of O
fixing O
the O
wages O
of O
the O
workmen O
concerned O
in O
these O
disputes O
is O
sitting O
at O
the O
present O
time. O
The O
interests O
of O
both O
the O
employers O
and O
labour O
will, O
we O
think, O
be O
best O
served O
if O
instead O
of O
confirming O
the O
order O
made O
by O
the O
Appellate O
Tribunal O
as O
regards O
the O
retaining O
allowance O
the O
workmen O
will O
raise O
this O
question O
of O
raising O
their O
wages O
in O
view O
of O
the O
seasonal O
nature O
of O
their O
employment O
before O
this O
Wage O
Board. O

In O
his O
opinion, O
the O
entire O
judgment O
displays O
a O
lack O
of O
true O
perspective O
in O
a O
case O
of O
this O
kind. O
The O
Sessions O
Judge O
had O
completely O
misdirected O
himself O
in O
looking O
to O
the O
minor O
discrepancies O
in O
the O
case O
and O
ignoring O
the O
essential O
matters O
so O
far O
as O
the O
case O
is O
concerned, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
justifiable O
ground O
for O
rejecting O
the O
prosecution O
evidence O
regarding O
the O
cultivation O
and O
harvesting O
by O
Polai. O
And O
he O
concluded O
with O
the O
warning O
I O
would, O
however, O
make O
it O
per- O
fectly O
clear O
that O
when O
the O
case O
is O
re-tried, O
which O
I O
am O
now O
going O
to O
order, O
the O
Judge O
proceeding O
with O
the O
trial O
will O
not O
be O
in O
the O
least O
influenced O
by O
any O
expression O
of O
opinion O
which O
I O
may O
have O
given O
in O
this O
judgment. O
On O
behalf O
of O
the O
appellants O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Sinha I-OTHER_PERSON
raised O
two O
conten- O
tions. O
In O
the O
first O
place, O
he O
submitted O
that O
having O
regard O
to O
section B-PROVISION
417 I-PROVISION
of O
the O
Criminal B-STATUTE
Procedure I-STATUTE
Code I-STATUTE
which O
provides O
for O
an O
appeal O
to O
the O
High O
Court O
from O
an O
order O
of O
acquittal O
only O
at O
the O
instance O
of O
the O
Government, O
a O
revision O
petition O
under O
section B-PROVISION
439 I-PROVISION
at O
the O
instance O
of O
a O
private O
party O
was O
incompetent, O
and, O
secondly, O
that O
sub-section O
(4) O
of O
section B-PROVISION
439 I-PROVISION
clearly O
showed O
that O
the O
High O
Court O
exceeded O
its O
powers O
of O
revision O
in O
the O
present O
case O
in O
upsetting O
the O
findings O
of O
fact O
of O
the O
trial O
Judge. O
We O
think O
it O
is O
unnecessary O
to O
express O
any O
opinion O
on O
the O
first O
contention O
of O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Sinha I-OTHER_PERSON
especially O
as O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
is O
unrepresented, O
as O
we O
are O
of O
opinion O
that O
his O
second O
and O
alternative O
contention O
must O
prevail. O
It O
will O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
judgment O
summarised O
above O
that O
the O
learned O
Judge O
in O
the O
High O
Court O
re-appraised O
the O
evi- O
dence O
in O
the O
case O
and O
disagreed O
with O
the O
Sessions O
Judges O
findings O
of O
fact O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
they O
were O
perverse O
and O
displayed O
a O
lack O
of O
true O
perspective. O
He O
went O
further O
and, O
by O
way O
of O
expressing O
in O
very O
clear O
terms O
as O
to O
how O
perverse O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O
court O
below O
is, O
he O
indicated O
that O
the O
discrepancies O
in O
the O
prosecution O
evidence O
and O
the O
circum- O
stances O
of O
the O
case O
which O
led O
the O
Sessions O
Judge O
to O
discred- O
it O
the O
prosecution O
story O
afforded O
no O
justifiable O
ground O
for O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
prosecution O
failed O
to O
establish O
their O
case. O
We O
are O
of O
opinion O
that O
the O
learned O
Judge O
in O
the O
High O
Court O
did O
not O
properly O
appreciate O
the O
scope O
of O
inquiry O
in O
revision O
against O
an O
order O
of O
acquittal. O
Though O
sub-section(1) O
of O
section B-PROVISION
439 I-PROVISION
authorises O
the O
High O
Court O
to O
exercise, O
in O
its O
discretion, O
any O
of O
the O
powers O
conferred O
on O
a O
court O
of O
appeal O
by O
section B-PROVISION
423, O
sub-section O
(4) O
specifically O
excludes O
the O
power O
to O
convert O
a O
finding O
of O
acquittal O
into O
one. O
of O
conviction. O
This O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
in O
dealing O
with O
a O
revision O
petition O
by O
a O
private O
party O
against O
an O
order O
of O
acquittal, O
the O
High O
Court O
could O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
error O
on O
a O
point O
of O
law O
re-appraise O
the O
evidence O
and O
reverse O
the O
findings O
of O
facts O
on O
which O
the O
acquittal O
was O
based, O
provided O
only O
it O
stopped O
short O
of O
finding O
the O
accused O
guilty O
and O
passing O
sentence O
on O
him. O
By O
merely O
characterising O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O
trial O
Court O
as O
perverse O
and O
lacking O
in O
perspective, O

The O
assessee, O
Her O
Highness O
Maharani O
Kesarkunverba O
Saheb, O
the O
Raj O
Mata O
of O
Morvi O
State, O
is O
the O
appellant O
and O
the O
Commissioner O
of O
Income-tax, O
Bombay O
North, O
is O
the O
respondent. O
The O
question O
that O
arises O
for O
decision O
is O
whether O
the O
annual O
cash O
allowance O
paid O
to O
the O
appellant O
in O
circumstances O
stated O
below O
falls O
within O
paragraph O
15(1)(i) O
of O
the O
Part O
B O
States O
(Taxation O
Concessions) O
Order, O
1950 O
(hereinafter O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
Order) O
and O
is O
therefore O
exempt O
from O
income-tax. O
The O
appellant O
was O
receiving O
from O
the O
Morvi O
State O
since O
1922 O
an O
allowance O
called O
Jiwai O
(maintenance O
allowance). O
By O
a O
resolution O
dated O
September O
26, O
1946, O
passed O
by O
His O
Highness O
Lukhdhirji O
of O
Morvi, O
the O
husband O
of O
the O
appellant, O
it O
was O
resolved O
that O
a O
sum O
of O
Rs. O
5,000 O
per O
month O
be O
paid O
to O
the O
appellant O
and O
provision O
be O
made O
for O
the O
amount O
by O
the O
Treasury O
Office O
in O
the O
Budget O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
as O
before. O
Reference O
in O
this O
connection O
was O
also O
made O
to O
the O
appellants O
letter O
dated O
May O
26, O
1949, O
wherein O
she O
insisted O
that O
the O
village O
should O
not O
be O
taken O
away O
from O
her O
as O
this O
would O
be O
unreasonable, O
arbitrary O
and O
contrary O
to O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
covenant. O
In O
our O
opinion O
the O
connection O
of O
the O
appellant O
is O
well O
founded. O
The O
Tribunal O
has O
found O
after O
going O
into O
all O
the O
documents O
including O
the O
document O
containing O
the O
words O
to O
maintain O
her O
status O
and O
dignity O
and O
the O
letter O
of O
the O
appellants O
husband O
to O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Buch I-OTHER_PERSON
which O
mentioned O
the O
word O
Abru O
that O
the O
grant O
of O
the O
village O
was O
by O
way O
of O
maintenance O
and O
merely O
because O
the O
appellants O
relations O
wanted O
a O
face-saving O
device O
by O
splitting O
up O
the O
total O
amount O
payable O
per O
year O
it O
would O
not O
change O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
transaction O
nor O
would O
it O
change O
the O
grant O
of O
maintenance O
made O
to O
the O
appellant O
into O
something O
else. O
The O
grant O
of O
the O
village O
was O
as O
much O
by O
way O
of O
maintenance O
as O
was O
the O
cash O
allowance O
called O
Jiwai. O
Maintenance O
must O
vary O
according O
to O
the O
position O
and O
status O
of O
a O
person. O
It O
does O
not O
only O
mean O
food O
and O
raiment. O
The O
appellant O
was O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
ruling O
prince O
and O
at O
the O
time O
the O
grant O
of O
the O
village O
was O
made, O
she O
was O
the O
Raj O
Mata O
and O
therefore O
neither O
the O
use O
of O
the O
words O
status O
and O
dignity O
nor O
the O
reference O
to O
ancient O
usage O
could O
in O
any O
way O
change O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
grant. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
appellant O
was O
anxious O
to O
retain O
the O
village O
because O
that O
gave O
her O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
having O
agricultural O
land O
which O
would O
be O
a O
tangible O
asset O
providing O
her O
a O
sure O
source O
of O
income O
but, O
merely O
because O
she O
wanted O
the O
village O
and O
in O
the O
resolution O
of O
March O
30, O
1950, O
mention O
is O
made O
of O
a O
sum O
an O
lieu O
of O
income O
from O
the O
village, O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
grant O
which O
in O
this O
case O
was O
by O
way O
of O
maintenance O
would O
not O
change. O
The O
question O
which O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
High O
Court O
was O
whether O
there O
was O
material O
to O
hold O
that O
the O
sum O
of O
Rs. O
35,807 O
was O
maintenance O
allowance, O
but O
the O
High O
Court O
reformulated O
this O
question O
and O
after O
going O
into O
various O
documents O
it O
came O
to O
a O
conclusion O
different O
from O
that O
of O
the O
Tribunal O
and O
it O
reversed O
the O
findings O
of O
the O
Tribunal O
and O
answered O
the O
question O
in O
a O
manner O
suggestive O
of O
an O
appellate O
rather O
than O
advisory O
jurisdiction. O

Industrial B-STATUTE
Disputes I-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
(No. O
14 O
of O

(hereinafter O
called O
the O
Act). O
That O
is O
a O
matter O
relating O
to O
the O
management O
of O
the O
undertaking O
and O
unless O
malafides O
are O
alleged O
or O
proved, O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
Industrial O
Tribunal O
has O
jurisdiction O
to O
sit O
in O
judgment O
over O
the O
acts O
of O
management O
of O
the O
employer O
and O
investigate O
whether O
a O
more O
prudent O
management O
could O
have O
avoided O
the O
situation O
which O
led O
to O
lay- O
off. O
The O
danger O
involved O
in O
permitting O
such O
jurisdiction O
to O
the O
Tribunal O
is O
illustrated O
by O
the O
present O
award O
itself. O
The O
Tribunal O
has O
found O
that O
the O
appellant O
was O
in O
financial O
difficulties O
at O
the O
relevant O
time O
it O
has O
found O
that O
the O
appellant O
was O
not O
actuated O
by O
any O
malafide O
intention, O
it O
has O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
lay-off O
was O
not O
the O
result O
of O
any O
uleriort O
motive, O
and O
yet O
it O
has O
finally O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
if O
the O
affairs O
of O
the O
appellant O
it O
had O
been O
better O
managed O
and O
more O
foresight O
had O
been O
shown O
by O
the O
appellant O
prior O
to O
the O
time O
when O
the O
crisis O
was O
reached, O
pig O
iron O
could O
have O
been O
secured O
and O
lay-off O
could O
have O
been O
avoided. O
Apart O
from, O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
conclusion O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
borne O
out O
by O
any O
evidence O
on O
record, O
it O
seems O
to O
us O
that O
the O
Tribunal O
exceeded O
its O
jurisdiction O
in O
trying O
to O
decide O
whether O
better. O
management O
could O
have O
avoided O
the O
crisis. O
The O
appellant O
is, O
no O
doubt, O
expected O
to O
manage O
its O
affairs O
prudently, O
but O
it O
would, O
we O
think, O
not O
be O
reasonable O
or O
fair O
to O
hold O
that O
if O
the O
employer O
is O
faced O
with O
a O
situation O
under O
which O
for O
lack O
of O
raw O
materials O
he O
has O
to O
lay-off O
his O
workmen, O
it O
is O
necessary O
that O
he O
must O
submit O
to O
an O
enquiry O
by O
the O
Industrial O
Tribunal O
about O
the O
prudence O
of O
the O
management O
and O
the O
forethought O
displayed O
by O
it O
in O
anticipating O
and O
avoiding O
the O
difficulties. O
That O
is O
why O
we O
think O
in O
embarking O
upon O
an O
enquiry O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
appellant O
had O
shown O
sufficient O
foresight O
in O
managing O
its O
affairs, O
the O
Tribunal O
has O
exceeded O
its O
jurisdiction. O
Besides, O
as O
we O
have O
just O
indicated, O
its O
finding O
on O
the O
question O
of O
negligence O
is O
not O
supported O
by O
any O
evidence O
on O
record O
nor O
by O
probabilities O
in O
the O
case. O
In O
that O
connection, O
it O
is O
significant O
that O
subsequently O
the O
section O
in O
question O
has O
been O
closed O
and O
the O
retrenched O
workmen O
have O
been O
paid O
retrenchment O
compensation O
due O
to O
them. O

No O

the O

of O
the O
appellants O
clearly O
indicated O
that O
even O
though O
they O
were O
dealing O
in O
shares O
of O
other O
companies, O
the O
shares O
of O
the O
Sholapur O
Mills O
were O
treated O
by O
them O
as O
capital O
investment O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
maintaining O
their O
managing O
agency. O
The O
number O
of O
shares O
held O
by O
the O
appellants O
went O
on O
increasing O
from O
time O
to O
time O
and O
not O
a O
single O
share O
was O
ever O
sold. O
The O
Tribunal O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
returns O
for O
the O
assessment O
years O
1945-46, O
1946-47 O
and O
1947-48 O
were O
filed O
by O
the O
appellants O
after O
they O
knew O
that O
there O
were O
wide O
fluctuations O
in O
the O
quotation O
of O
the O
shares O
of O
that O
company. O
They O
also O
referred O
to O
the O
circumstance O
that O
the O
appellants O
were O
interested O
in O
the O
managing O
agency O
of O
the O
Sholapur O
Mills O
and O
that O
every O
member O
of O
the O
family O
of O
the O
appellants O
was O
holding O
shares O
The O
conclusion O
of O
the O
Tribunal O
was O
amply O
supported O
by O
evidence. O
It O
can O
not O
be O
said O
that O
because O
in O
the O
previous O
years O
the O
shares O
were O
held O
to O
be O
stock-in-trade, O
they O
must O
be O
similarly O
treated O
for O
the O
assessment O
year O
1949-50. O
In O
the O
matter O
of O
assessment O
of O
income-tax, O
each O
years O
assessment O
is O
complete O
and O
the O
decision O
arrived O
at O
in O
a O
previous O
year O
on O
material O
before O
the O
taxing O
authorities O
cannot O
be O
regarded O
as O
binding O
in O
the O
assessment O
for O
the O
subsequent O
years. O
The O
Tribunal O
is O
not O
shown O
to O
have O
omitted O
to O
consider O
the O
material O
facts. O
The O
decision O
of O
the O
Tribunal O
was O
on O
a O
question O
of O
fact O
and O
no O
question O
of O
law O
arose O
which O
could O
be O
directed O
to O
be O
referred O
under O
section B-PROVISION
66(2) O
of O
the O
Income-tax O
Act. O

deprecating O
a O

18. O
We O
therefore O
agree O
with O
the O
learned O
Solicitor O
General O
that O
the O
Court O
should O
not O
permit O
hearing O
of O
such O
an O
application O
for O

or O
recall O
if O
the O
application O
is O
in O

one O

In O
that O

the O
Court O
could O
either O
reject O
the O
application O
straight O

with O

or O
permit O

19. O
What O
we O
have O
said O
above O
equally O
applies O
to O
such O
applications O
filed O
after O
rejection O
of O
review O
applications O
particularly O
when O
a O
second O

is O
not O
permissible O
under O
the O
Rules. O
Under O
Order O
XL O
Rule O
5 O
a O
second O

is O
not O
permitted. O
The O
said O
Rule O
reads O
as O
follows O

Where O
an O
application O
for O

of O
any O
judgment O

has O
been O
made O

of O
no O
further O

shall O
be O
entertained O
in O

20. O
We O
should O
not O
however O
be O

as O
saying O
that O
in O
no O

an O
application O

or O

is O
maintainable O
after O
the O
first O

All O
that O
we O
are O
saying O
is O
that O
once O
such O
an O

is O
listed O
in O
Court O
the O
Court O
will O
examine O
whether O
it O
is O
in O

in O
the O
nature O
of O

Point O

is O
decided O
accordingly. O
We O
are O
of O
the O
view O
that O
the O
ratio O
laid O
down O
in O
the O
above O
mentioned O
Judgment O
squarely O
applies O
to O
the O
facts O
of O
this O

of O
a O
typographical O

These O

are O
directed O
against O
three O
judgments O
and O
orders O
of O
the O
Punjab O
High O
Court O
in O
three O
Civil O
Revisions O
Nos. O
166-D, O
167-D O
and O
168-D O
which O
were O
brought O
by O
the O
appellants O
against O
three O
of O
their O
tenants O
under O
s. O
35 O
of O
the O
Delhi B-STATUTE
Ajmer I-STATUTE
Rent I-STATUTE
Control I-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
(XXXVIII O
of O
1952), O
hereinafter O
termed O
the O
Act. O
The O
appellants O
in O
all O
the O
three O
appeals O
are O
the O
landlords O
and O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
in O
the O
three O
appeals O
are O
three O
different O
tenants. O
The O
appellants O
filed O
three O
separate O
suits O
for O
the O
eviction O
of O
their O
three O
tenants O
under O
cl. O
(g) O
of O
proviso O
to O
s. O
13(1) O
of O
the O
Act O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
the O
premises O
were O
bona O
fide O
required O
for O
purposes O
of O
rebuilding. O
On O
February O
27, O
1953, O
the O
parties O
in O
all O
the O
three O
suits O
entered O
into O
a O
compromise O
in O
the O
following O
terms O
We O
have O
compromised O
the O
case O
with O
the O
plaintiff. O
A O
decree O
may O
be O
passed O
for O
Rs. O
82/8/- O
on O
account O
of O
rent O
in O
suit O
and O
for O
ejectment O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
shop O
in O
suit O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
against O
the O
defendants O
The O
defendants O
will O
vacate O
the O
shop O
by O
4-3-53 O
and O
hand O
over O
possession O
to O
the O
plaintiff O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
will O
hand O
over O
its O
possession O
again O
(second O
time) O
to O
the O
defendants O
within O
six O
months O
from O
4-3-53 O
after O
constructing O
it O
afresh. O
It O
was O
submitted O
that O
although O
the O
time O
for O
giving O
delivery O
to O
the O
appellants O
was O
fixed O
in O
the O
compromise O
it O
was O
not O
of O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
contract. O
In O
our O
opinion O
the O
contentions O
raised O
by O
the O
appellants O
are O
well O
founded O
and O
the O
appellants O
must O
succeed. O
The O
suits O
for O
eviction O
were O
brought O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
Act O
and O
were O
based O
on O
the O
provisions O
of O
s. O
13, O
proviso O
(g). O
No O
eviction O
would O
have O
been O
possible O
excepting O
when O
conditions O
laid O
down O
in O
s. O
13 O
were O
satisfied. O
The O
decrees O
which O
were O
passed O
were O
substantially O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
provisions O
of O
s. O
15 O
of O
the O
Act O
and O
as O
was O
contended O
by O
the O
appellants O
they O
were O
decrees O
under O
which O
the O
premises O
had O
to O
be O
vacated O
by O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
on O
a O
specified O
day. O
Under O
that O
section O
they O
had O
the O
right O
to O
elect O
and O
did O
elect O
to O
get O
possession O
after O
rebuilding O
this O
possession O
was O
to O
be O
given O
by O
the O
landlords O
to O
the O
tenants O
within O
a O
reasonable O
time O
and O
six O
months O
period O
was O
fixed O
by O
Consent O
between O
the O
parties O
and O
the O
rent, O
if O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
were O
not O
put O
into O
possession O
on O
the O
same O
terms O
as O
before, O
was O
to O
be O
settled O
by O
court O
and O
that O
is O
what O
was O
done O
under O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
consent O
decree. O
The O
applications O
for O
being O
put O
into O
possession O
which O
were O
filed O
by O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
were O
really O
under O
s. O
15(3) O
of O
the O
Act. O
As O
the O
respondents B-RESPONDENT
did O
not O
deli- O
ver O
possession O
to O
the O
appellants O
on O
or O
before O
the O
dates O
specified O
in O
the O
decree O
the O
provisions O
of O
s. O
15 O
contained O
in O
sub-s. O
(3) O
of O
that O
Act O
were O
not O
available O
to O
them O
and O
they O
were O
,not O
entitled O
to O
be O
put O
into O
possession O
as O
prayed O
by O
them. O
It O
was O
argued O
that O
the O
appellants O
had O
taken O
possession O
of O
the O
premises O
after O
the O
specified O
date O
without O
protest O
and O
had O
even O
accepted O
rent O
upto O
then O
and O
were O
therefore O
estopped O
from O
raising O
that O
defence. O

This O
is O
appeal O
from O
the O
Judgment O
of O
the O
High B-COURT
Court I-COURT
of I-COURT
Judicature I-COURT
at O
Bombay O
delivered O
on O
a O
reference O
under O
Section O
66(1) O
of O
the O
Indian O
Income-tax O
Act, O
1922, O
whereby O
the O
High O
Court O
answered O
the O
first O
referred O
question O
in O
the O
negative. O
The O
assessment O
in O
question O
concern O
the O
year O
1943-44. O
A O
Hindu O
undivided O
family O
was O
carrying O
on O
business O
in O
Bombay, O
Madras O
and O
the O
Mysore O
State. O
Its O
business O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
a O
registered O
firm O
on O
March O
17, O
1942. O
For O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
appeal O
however O
this O
circumstance O
is O
not O
material. O
The O
case O
has O
been O
dealt O
with O
on O
the O
assumption O
that O
a O
single O
assessee O
carried O
on O
business O
from O
October O
10, O
1948, O
to O
November O
8, O
1942, O
the O
relevant O
accounting O
year. O
According O
to O
the O
accounts O
of O
the O
assessee, O
during O
this O
period O
the O
Mysore O
branch O
purchased O
goods O
from O
the O
Bombay O
head O
office O
and O
the O
Madras O
branch O
of O
the O
value O
of O
Rs. O
2,45,455. O
The O
Income-tax O
Officer O
estimated O
these O
purchases O
of O
the O
Mysore O
branch O
in O
British O
India O
at O
Rs. O
3,00,000 O
and O
its O
profits O
at O
Rs. O
75,000 O
on O
the O
sale O
of O
these O
goods O
in O
Mysore. O
In O
view O
of O
the O
provisions O
of O
Section O
42 O
of O
the O
Act O
half O
of O
this O
profit, O
i.e., O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
Rs. O
37,500, O
was O
deemed O
to O
accrue O
or O
a O
rise O
in O
British O
India, O
because O
of O
the O
business O
connection O
of O
the O
non-resident O
branch O
in O
British O
India. O
It O
was O
contended O
that O
the O
assessee O
being O
a O
person O
resident O
in O
India, O
Section O
42 O
could O
not O
be O
invoked O
in O
the O
case, O
because O
that O
section O
had O
application O
only O
to O
cases O
of O
non-resident. O
The O
same O
view O
was O
expressed O
by O
Mukherjea, O
J. O
Nothing O
that O
has O
been O
said O
by O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Kolah I-OTHER_PERSON
before O
us O
justifies O
reconsideration O
of O
these O
opinions. O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Kolah I-OTHER_PERSON
argued O
that O
when O
the O
world O
income O
of O
a O
resident O
was O
brought O
within O
the O
net O
of O
chargeability O
by O
Section O
4 O
in O
1939 O
it O
was O
then O
wholly O
unnecessary O
to O
include O
such O
an O
assessee O
in O
the O
ambit O
of O
Section O
42. O
In O
our O
judgment, O
this O
contention O
is O
fallacious. O
Whatever O
income O
arises O
in O
a O
primary O
sense O
to O
a O
resident O
in O
the O
taxable O
territories O
is O
chargeable O
under O
Section O
4(1)(b)(i). O
Hence O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
make O
Section O
42 O
applicable O
to O
such O
a O
case. O
Whatever O
other O
consideration O
may O
arise O
in O
estimating O
the O
foreign O
income O
of O
a O
resident O
will O
not O
be O
applicable O
to O
income O
deemed O
to O
accrue O
within O
the O
taxable O
territory. O
Moreover, O
as O
above O
pointed O
out, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
provisions O
of O
Section O
14(2)(c), O
resident O
assessees, O
but O
for O
Section O
42(1), O
would O
not O
be O
liable O
to O
assessment O
regarding O
income O
accruing O
to O
them O
in O
Part O
B O
States, O
even O
if O
there O
is O
a O
business O
connection O
in O
the O
taxable O
territory. O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Kolan I-OTHER_PERSON
was O
unable O
to O
suggest O
any O
reasonable O
explanation O
for O
the O
deletion O
of O
the O
words O
any O
person O
residing O
out O
of O
British O
India O
from O
Section O
42(1) O
as O
it O
stood O
before O
1939. O
The O
only O
purpose O
in O
deleting O
these O
words O
could O
be O
to O
bring O
residents O
within O
the O
ambit O
of O
the O
section. O
There O
is O
no O
reason O
whatsoever O
for O
not O
giving O
to O
the O
palin O
words O
of O
the O
section O
the O
meaning O
that O
on O
the O
face O
of O
it O
they O
bear. O
For O
the O
reasons O
given O
above O
we O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
answer O
re O
turned O
by O
the O
High B-COURT
Court I-COURT
of I-COURT
Bombay I-COURT
to O
the O
first O
question O
referred O
to O
it O
was O
wrong. O

We O

It O

Suffice O
it O
to O
say O
that O
the O

was O

on O
the O

that O

(Act O
XVI O
of O

as O
no O

subsisted O
on O

It O
therefore O
follows O
that O
the O
only O
property O
which O
a O

may O
redeem O
is O
the O
property O
on O
which O
the O

enforce O
his O

From O
the O
very O

the O
right O

can O
be O
exercised O
in O
respect O
of O
such O
pro- O
perty O
only O
as O
is O
subject O

There O
can O
be O
nothing O
for O
enforcing O
a O
mortgage O
when O
the O
money O
has O
been O
paid O
up O
and O
therefore O
the O
right O

contemplates O
a O

the O

on O
the O
other O
hand, O

Section O
62 O
says O
that O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
usufructuary O
mortgage O
the O
mortgagor O
has O
a O
right O
to O
recover O
possession O
of O
the O
property O
when O
(In O
a O
case O
in O
which O
the O
mortgagee O
is O
authorised O
to O
pay O
himself O
the O
mortgage O
money O
out O
of O
the O
rents O
and O
,profits O
of O
the O
property) O
the O
principal O
money O
is O
paid O
off. O
As O
we O
see O
it, O
that O
is O
not O
a O
case O
of O
redemption O
at O
all. O
At O
the O
moment O
when O
the, O
rents O
and O
profits O
of O
the O
mortgaged O
property O
sufficed O
to O
discharge O
the O
principal O
secured O
by O
th O
e O
mortgage, O
the O
mortgage O
came O
to O
an O
end O
and O
the O
correlative O
right O
arose O
in O
the O
mortgagor O
to O
recover O
possession O
of O
the O
property. O
The O
framers O
of O
the O
Transfer O
of O
Property B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
have O
clearly O
recognised O
the O
distinction O
between O
the O
procedure O
which O
follows O
a O
mortgagors O
desire O
to O
redeem O
a O
subsisting O
mortgage O
and O
the O
procedure O
which O
follows O
the O
arising O
of O
a O
usufructuary O
mortgagors O
right O
to O
get O
his O
property O
back O
after O
the O
principal O
has O
been O
paid O
off. O
We O
therefore O
hold O
that O
the O
mortgage O
was O
not O
subsisting O
on O
the O
date O
of O
vesting, O
it O
having O
come O
to O
an O
end O
on O
payment O
of O
the O
mortgage O
money O
in O
1943. O
and O

the O

cannot O
get O

advantage O
of O

of O

Act. O

he O
appellant O
is O
the O
U. O
P. O
Electric O
Supply O
Co. O
Ltd., O
Lucknow, O
(hereinafter O
called O
the O
company). O
It O
appears O
that O
the O
company O
used O
to O
employ O
Messrs. O
s O
M. O
Choudhary O
(hereinafter O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
contractors) O
as O
its O
contractors O
for O
doing O
certain O
work O
for O
it. O
The O
contractors O
in O
their O
turn O
used O
to O
employ O
a O
number O
of O
persons O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
work O
which O
they O
had O
taken O
on O
contract. O
A O
dispute O
arose O
between O
the O
contractors O
and O
their O
workmen O
in O
1956 O
and O
an O
application O
was O
made O
on O
June O
6, O
1956, O
by O
the O
workmen O
before O
the O
conciliation O
board. O
The O
tribunal O
went O
into O
the O
evidence O
in O
this O
connection O
and O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
these O
workmen O
were O
in O
fact O
and O
in O
reality O
the O
employees O
of O
the O
company. O
The O
main O
contention O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
company O
before O
us O
is O
that O
even O
assuming O
that O
the O
Government O
had O
power O
under O
s. O

read O
with O
cl. O

No. O
U-464 O
(LL)XXXVI-B- O
257(LL)/1954, O
dated O
July O
14, O
1954, O
to O
implied O
the O
company O
as O
a O
party, O
the O
main O
issue O
decided O
by O
the O
tribunal O
was O
not O
referred O
to O
it O
and O
the O
tribunal O
could O
only O
decide O
the O
three O
matters O
of O
dispute O
included O
in O
the O
order O
of O
reference O
of O
July O
31, O
1956. O
Therefore, O
in O
so O
far O
as O
the O
tribunal O
went O
beyond O
the, O
three O
matters O
of O
dispute O
specified O
in O
the O
reference O
and O
decided O
the O
question O
whether O
the O
workmen O
concerned O
were O
in O
the O
employ O
of O
the O
company O
or O
of O
the O
contractors O
it O
was O
acting O
without O
jurisdiction O
as O
this O
matter O
was O
never O
referred O
to O
it. O
We O
are O
of O
opinion O
that O
this O
contention O
must O
prevail. O
As O
we O
have O
already O
pointed O
out, O
there O
were O
four O
matters O
before O
the O
conciliation O
board O
including O
the O
question O
of O
non-abolition O
of O
the O
contract O
system. O
Further O
before O
the O
conciliation O
board O
not O
only O
the O
contractors O
but O
the O
company O
was O
also O
a O
party, O
for O
obviously O
the O
question O
of O
non-abolition O
of O
the O
contract O
system O
would O
necessitate O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
company O
as O
a O
party O
to O
the O
proceedings. O
When O
however O
the O
Government O
referred O
the O
dispute O
to O
the O
tribunal O
on O
July O
31, O
it O
did O
not O
include O
the O
fourth O
item O
which O
was O
before O
the O
conciliation O
board O
relating O
to O
the O
non-abolition O
of O
the O
contract O
system O
among O
the O
matters O
in O
dispute. O
It O
also O
did O
not O
include O
the O
company O
as O
one O
of O
the O
parties O
to O
the O
dispute, O
for O
the O
reference-order O
refers O
only O
to O
two O
parties O
to O
the O
dispute, O
namely, O
the O
contractors O
and O
their O
workmen. O
On O
such O
a O
reference O
there O
could O
be O
no O
jurisdiction O
in O
the O
tribunal O
to O
decide O
the O
question O
whether O
these O
workmen O
were O
the O
workmen O
of O
the O
company O
or O
of O
the O
contractors, O
for O
such O
a O
question O
was O
not O
referred O
to O
the O
tribunal. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
on O
August O
13, O
1956, O
the O
company O
was O
impleaded O
as O
a O
party O
to O
the O
dispute O
referred O
by O
the O
notification O
of O
July O
31 O
but O
the O
matters O
in O
dispute O
remained O
unmended, O
and O
the O
question O
of O
non-abolition O
of O
the O
contract O
system O
or O
the O
question O
whether O
these O
workmen O
were O
the O
employees O
of O
the O
company O
in O
fact O
and O
in O
reality O
was O
not O
included O
in O
the O
matters O
of O
dispute O
by O
amendment O
under O
the O
proviso O
to O
s. O

of O

The O
appellant O
A2 O
Azeez O
along O
with O
two O
others O
i.e. O
A1 O
Khalid O

was O
tried O
by O

for O
offences O

Magistrate O
convicted O
the O
appellant O
under O
Section O
457 O
of O
the O
IPC O
and O
sentenced O
him O
to O
undergo O
rigorous O
imprisonment O
for O
one O
year. O
The O
appellant O
was O
further O
convicted O
for O
offence O
under O
Section O
380 O
of O
the O
IPC O
and O
sentenced O
to O
undergo O
rigorous O
imprisonment O
for O
two O
years. O
The O
substantive O
sentences O
were O
ordered O
to O
run O
concurrently. O
A1 O
Khalid O
and O
A3 O
Babu O
were O
acquitted. O
The O
Trial O
Court O
also O
acquitted O
A1 O
and O
A3 O
of O
the O
offence O
punishable O
under O
Section O
457 O
read O
with O
Section O
34 O
of O
the O
IPC. O
The O
Trial O
Court O
however O
observed O
that O
from O
the O
evidence O
of O
PWs O
1 O
and O
2 O
it O
is O
seen O
that O
theft O
had O
taken O
in O
the O
room O
in O
which O
PW2 O
was O
sleeping O
the O
thief O
entered O
the O
house O
and O
committed O
theft O
of O
gold O
chain O
which O
PW2 O
was O
wearing O
and O
therefore O
this O
act O
will O
be O
covered O
by O
Section O
451 O
of O
the O
IPC O
i.e. O
house O
trespass O
in O
order O
to O
commit O
offence O
punishable O
with O
imprisonment. O
The O
Trial O
Court O
further O
held O
that O
since O
the O
recovery O
of O
gold O
chain O
was O
effected O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
statement O
given O
by O
the O
appellant O
the O
only O
inference O
that O
can O
be O
drawn O
is O
that O
he O
committed O
the O
theft O
of O
gold O
chain O
and O
therefore O
the O
case O
is O
covered O
by O
Section O
380 O
of O
the O
IPC O
i.e O
theft O
in O
a O
dwelling O
house. O
After O
observing O
that O
there O
is O
nothing O
in O
the O
evidence O
of O
PWs O
1 O
to O
8 O
to O
connect O
A1 O
and O
A3 O
with O
the O
crime O
the O
Trial O
Court O
acquitted O
them O
of O
all O
the O
offences. O
This O
view O
is O
affirmed O
by O
the O
Sessions O
Court O
and O
the O
High O
Court. O
We O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
uphold O
the O
above O
view O
so O
far O
as O
it O
relates O
to O
the O
appellant. O
As O
we O
have O
already O
noted O
that O
FIR O
was O
registered O
after O
about O
sixteen O
days O
from O
the O
date O
of O
alleged O
theft. O
PWs O
1 O
and O
2 O
did O
not O
even O
realize O
that O
the O
chain O
was O
stolen. O
It O
is O
only O
when O
the O
accused O
were O
brought O
to O
their O
house O
after O
about O
sixteen O
days O
that O
they O
realized O
that O
the O
chain O
was O
stolen O
and O
FIR O
was O
lodged. O
The O
chain O
in O
question O
was O
being O
worn O
by O
PW2. O
It O
is O
stated O
to O
have O
been O
stolen O
while O
she O
was O
sleeping. O
It O
is O
inconceivable O
that O
she O
would O
not O
realize O
that O
she O
had O
lost O
her O
chain. O
The O
incident O
in O
our O
view O
is O
not O
unfolded O
truthfully. O
A1 O
and O
A3 O
have O
been O
rightly O
acquitted O
because O
nothing O
links O
them O
to O
the O
offence. O
But O
similar O
is O
the O
case O
with O
the O
appellant. O
The O
only O
evidence O
against O
him O
is O
the O
alleged O
recovery O
of O
gold O
chain O
at O
his O
instance. O
That O
cannot O
connect O
the O
appellant O
to O
the O
theft. O
The O
Trial O
Court O
has O
stated O
that O
since O
chain O
was O
recovered O
at O
the O
instance O
of O
the O
appellant O
the O
only O
inference O
which O
can O
be O
drawn O
is O
that O
he O
committed O
the O
theft. O
Drawing O
such O
inference O
in O
the O
facts O
of O
this O
case O
would O
be O
totally O
unjust. O

is O
an O
