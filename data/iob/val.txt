By O

communication O
dated O
April O

from O
the O
Secretary O
to O
the O
Government O
of O
the O
Central O
Provinces O
addressed O
to O
the O
Commissioner O
Jabalpur O
Division, O
certain O
Nazul O
land O
was O
made O
available O
to O
the O
Municipal O
Committee O
of O
Jabalpur. O
In O
this O
letter O
the O
Secretary O
Stated O
I O
am O
directed O
by O
the O
Governor O
in O
Council O
with O
the O
previous O
sanction O
of O
the O
Government O
of O
India O
to O
communicate O
the O
following O
orders O
of O
the O
Government O
of O
the O
Central O
Provinces O
- O
Under O
Section O
38(1)(f) O
of O
the O
Central B-STATUTE
Provinces I-STATUTE
Municipalities I-STATUTE
Act, I-STATUTE
1922, I-STATUTE
Government O
is O
pleased O
to O
transfer O
to O
the O
Municipal O
Committee, O
Jubbiilpore, O
free O
of O
premium O
and O

nazul O
land O
measuring O

Jabbulpore O
town. O
In O
our O
opinion, O
on O
the O
allegations O
made O
in O
the O
petition O
by O
the O
appellant O
Corporation O
it O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
been O
permitted O
to O
put O
forward O
a O
case O
that O
the O
State O
Government O
was O
not O
the O
transferor O
of O
the O
property O
and O
the O
learned O
Judges O
of O
the O
High O
Court O
should O
have O
proceeded O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
pleadings O
in O
the O
case. O
Apart O
from O
this O
question O
of O
pleading, O
we O
consider O
that O
there O
is O
no O
merit O
in O
the O
contention O
even O
otherwise. O
We O
have O
already O
set O
out O
the O
terms O
by O
which O
the O
transfer O
of O
the O
land O
was O
communicated O
to O
the O
Municipal O
Committee. O
The O
preamble O
recites O
that O
is O
what O
being O
communicated O
is O
the O
order O
of O
the O
Government O
of O
the O
Central O
Provinces. O
The O
words O
of O
conveyance O
are O
in O
the O
second O
paragraph O
and O
they O
read O
Under O
section B-PROVISION
38(1)(f) O
of O
the O
Central B-STATUTE
Provinces I-STATUTE
Municipalities I-STATUTE
Act, I-STATUTE
1922 I-STATUTE
Government O
is O
pleased O
to O
transfer O
to O
the O
Municipal O
Committee O
. O
The O
expression O
Government O
here O
obviously, O
in O
the O
context, O
means O
the O
Government O
of O
the O
Central O
Provinces. O
Paragraph O
2 O
which O
specifies O
what O
should O
happen O
if O
the O
condition O
on O
which O
the O
land O
has O
been O
granted O
should O
be O
broken, O
states O
The O
land O
shall O
be O
liable O
to O
be. O
divested O
under O
s. O
38 O
(2) O
and O
resumed O
by O
Government O
. O
Government O
here O
again O
obviously O
is O
the O
Government O
of O
the O
Central O
Provinces O
a O
construction O
reinforced O
if O
one O
looked O
at O
the O
sub-section O
referred O
to. O
Further, O
in O
Condition O
3 O
which O
speaks O
of O
what O
was O
to O
happen O
if O
the O
land O
was O
resumed O
by O
Government O
for O
any O
Government O
purpose O
the O
reference O
to O
Government O
again O
is O
to O
the O
State O
Government. O
On O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
document O
therefore O
it O
was O
the O
Government O
of O
the O
Central O
Provinces O
that O
made O
the O
grant-the O
predecessor O
of O
the O
State O
Government. O
We O
find O
therefore O
that O
there O
is O
no O
factual O
foundation O
for O
the O
submission O
which O
was O
apparently O
made O
before O
the O
High O
Court O
that O
the O
transfer O
in O
the O
present O
case O
was O
by O
the O
Central O
Government. O
No O
doubt, O
the O
communication O
refers O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
previous O
to O
making O
the O
grant O
the O
Government O
of O
C. O
P. O
Berar O
had O
obtained O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
Central O
Government, O
but O
that O
was O
merely O
a O
matter O
of O
administrative O
arrangement O
between O
the O
Central O
and O
Local O
Governments O
which O
is O
totally O
irrelevant O
for O
determining O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
Government O
which O
made O
the O
grant. O
Besides, O
the O
corporation O
having O
accepted O
the O
grant O
from O
the O
State O
Government O
was O
obviously O
estopped O
from O
contending O
that O
the O
land O
of O
which O
it O
continued O
in O
possession O
under O
that O
grant O
was O
not O
one O
by O
the O
State O
Government O
or O
that O
the O
State O
Government O
had O
not O
the O
authority O
to O
make O
the O
grant. O
If O
such O
contention O
is O
both O
not O
open O
to O
the O
Corporation O
and O
not O
tenable O
on O
the O
merits., O
it O
would O
follow O
that O
the O
impugned O
notification O
was O
fully O
justified O
by O
the, O
provisions O
under O
s. O
81 O
of O
the O
Jabalpur B-STATUTE

by O

State O

In O
the O
case O
of O
an O
offence O
involving O
physical O
violence O
the O
person O
who O
instigates O
or O
aids O
the O
commission O
of O
the O
crime O
must O
be O
physically O
present O
and O
such O
presence O
of O
those O
who O
in O
one O
way O
or O
the O
other O
facilitate O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
common O
design O
is O
itself O
tantamount O
to O
actual O
participation O
in O
the O
criminal O
act O
Insofar O
as O
common O
intention O
is O
concerned O
it O
is O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
of O
an O
accused O
which O
can O
be O
inferred O
objectively O
from O
his O
conduct O
displayed O
in O
the O
course O
of O
commission O
of O
crime O
and O
also O
from O
prior O
and O
subsequent O
attendant O
circumstances. O
As O
observed O
in O
Hari O
Ram O
vs.State O
of O
U.P O
2004 O
8 O
SCC O
146 O
the O
existence O
of O
direct O
proof O
of O
common O
intention O
is O
seldom O
available O
and O
therefore O
such O
intention O
can O
only O
be O
inferred O
from O
the O
circumstances O
appearing O
from O
the O
proved O
facts O
of O
the O
case O
and O
the O
proved O
circumstances. O
Therefore O
in O
order O
to O
bring O
home O
the O
charge O
of O
common O
intention O
the O
prosecution O
has O
to O
establish O
by O
evidence O
whether O
direct O
or O
circumstantial O
that O
there O
was O
plan O
or O
meeting O
of O
mind O
of O
all O
the O
accused O
persons O
to O
commit O
the O
offence O
before O
a O
person O
can O
be O
vicariously O
convicted O
for O
the O
act O
of O
the O
other. O
The O
facts O
in O
the O
present O
case O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
evidences O
on O
record O
are O
that O
A O
1 O
and O
A O
2 O
are O
brothers O
having O
an O
old O
enmity O
with O
the O
deceased O
resulting O
in O
a O
constant O
skirmish O
over O
the O
well O
located O
in O
their O
lands. O
On O
the O
said O
date O
of O
incident O
the O
animosity O
culminated O
to O
an O
assault O
on O
the O
deceased O
by O
the O
accused O
persons O
when O
the O
deceased O
was O
nearing O
his O
land. O
It O
has O
come O
in O
the O
evidence O
of O
PW O
6 O
that O
A O
1 O
was O
assaulting O
the O
deceased O
with O
stones O
and O
A O
2 O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
chest O
of O
the O
deceased. O
The O
aforesaid O
chain O
of O
events O
gives O
a O
clear O
picture O
of O
the O
whole O
incident O
that O
had O
taken O
place O
on O
that O
fateful O
day. O
The O
evidence O
of O
PW O
6 O
when O
seen O
in O
entirety O
and O
in O
its O
proper O
perspective O
we O
can O
conclude O
that O
both O
the O
accused O
persons O
i.e. O
A O
1 O
and O
A O
2 O
had O
a O
common O
intention O
to O
assault O
and O
kill O
the O
deceased O
person O
with O
A O
2 O
as O
a O
participant O
in O
the O
crime O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
lending O
weight O
to O
the O
commission O
of O
an O
offence O
pursuant O
to O
a O
pre O
concerted O
plan. O

In O
substance, O
it O
was O
nothing O
but O
a O
certification O
by O
the O
decree-holder O
of O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
the O
decree. O
The O

fact O

1929 O
P.C. O
19, O
that O
the O
document O
was O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
petition O
could O
not O
convert O
what O
was O
really O
the O
usual O
certifying O
procedure O
into O
a O
proceeding O
in O
execution O
for O
recovery O
of O
a O
loan O
or O
for O
enforcement O
of O
any O
agreement. O
It O
was O
purely O
an O
intimation O
given O
to O
the O
Court O
by O
the O
decreeholder O
that O
the O
decree O
had O
been O
satisfied O
out O
of O
Court O
and O
the O
prayer O
for O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
attachment O
was O
merely O
consequential O
and O
would O
follow O
as O
a O
matter O
of O

on O
full O
satisfaction O
of O
the O
decree O
being O
recorded. O
The O
order O
made O
on O
that O
petition O
also O
shows O
that O
the O
decree O
was O
recorded O
as O
adjusted O
and O
the O
attachment O
was O
cancelled. O
In O
my O
judgment, O
that O
petition O
(Ex. O
2a) O
was O
not O
an O
application O
such O
as O
would O
initiate O
a O
proceeding O
in O
execution O
for O
any O
of O
the O
purposes O
mentioned O
in O

(a) O
or O
(b) O
or O
(c) O
of O
section B-PROVISION

of O
the O

For O
reasons O
stated O
above, O
the O

not O

The B-STATUTE
Act I-STATUTE
affords O
relief O
to O
certain O

by O

In O
such O
a O

the O
only O

could O
be O
whether O
the O

such O
as O
to O
establish O
a O

The O
short O
question O
of O

which O
falls O
to O
be O
decided O
in O
the O

is O
whether O
a O
dispute O
raised O

the O

General B-ORG
Insurance I-ORG

against O
their O

for O

S. O
10(1) O
of O
the O
Industrial B-STATUTE
Disputes I-STATUTE
Act, I-STATUTE
1947 I-STATUTE
(XIV O
of O
1947). O
Payment O
of O
bonus O
by O
insurers O
was O
intended O
by O
the O
legislature O
to O
be O
conditioned O
by O
the O
provisions O
contained O
in O
the O
said O
clause, O
and O
we O
feel O
no O
doubt O
or O
difficulty O
in O
reaching O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
intervention O
of O
the O
Industrial O
Tribunals O
was O
intended O
to O
be O
excluded O
and O
the O
matter O
was O
intended O
to O
be O
kept O
within O
the O
discretion O
of O
the O
Central O
Government O
so O
far O
as O
the O
payment O
of O
bonus O
by O
the O
insurers O
is O
concerned. O
Then, O
as O
to O
the O
argument O
that O
the O
Government O
directive O
issued O
under O
proviso O
(vii) O
may O
not O
be O
obeyed O
by O
any O
insurer, O
we O
do O
not O
think O
that O
such O
an O
event O
is O
likely O
to O
happen O
but O
theoretically O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
an O
insurer O
may O
refuse O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
Government. O
In O
that O
case O
all O
we O
can O
say O
is O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lacuna O
left O
and O
the O
legislature O
may O
consider O
whether O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
provide O
adequate O
remedy O
for O
making O
the O
Government O
decision O
binding O
and O
final. O
Having O
regard O
to O
the O
unqualified O
and O
absolute O
prohibition O
contained O
in O
s. O
31A(1)(c) O
it O
seems O
to O
us O
difficult O
to O
hold O
that O
the O
payment O
of O
bonus O
to O
the O
employees O
of O
Insurance O
Companies O
is O
not O
absolutely O
conditioned O
by O
proviso O
(vii). O
In O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
said O
provision O
no O
bonus O
could O
have O
been O
claimed O
by O
Insurance O
employees, O
and O
so O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
said O
provision O
must O
be O
to O
limit O
the O
said O
right O
to O
the O
conditions O
prescribed O
by O
it. O
That O
is O
why O
we O
think O
that O
the O
Tribunal O
was O
right O
in O
coming O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
reference O
made O
by O
the O
Central O
Government O
is O
invalid. O
The O
fact O
that O
the O
Central O
Government O
took O
the O
view O
that O
it O
could O
make O
such O
a O
reference O
1001 O
is O
hardly O
relevant O
in O
determining O
the O
scope O
and O
effect O
of O
the O
relevant O
provisions O
of O
the O
Act. O
This O
question O
must O
be O
considered O
on O
what O
we O
regard O
to O
be O
the O
fair O
construction O
of O
the O
relevant O
statutory O
provision, O
and O
as O
we O
have O
just O
indicated O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
relevant O
provision O
clearly O
supports O
the O
view O
taken O
by O
the O
Tribunal. O
Incidentally, O
it O
may O
be O
pointed O
out O
that O
in O
its O
award O
the O
Tribunal O
has O
referred O
to O
several O
other O
decisions O
of O
Industrial O
Tribunals O
which O
have O
taken O
the O
same O
view O
though O
there O
are O
one O
or O
two O
decisions O
which O
have O
upheld O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
reference O
without O
duly O
considering O
the O
effect O
of O
s. O
31A(1). O
In O
this O
connection O
we O
may O
refer O
to O
the O
decision O
of O
this O
court O
in O
The B-ORG
Central I-ORG

v. I-PRECEDENT

(1), O
where O
a O
similar O
question O
has O
been O
considered. O
In O
that O
case O
the O
Court O
had O
to O
consider O
the O
effect O
of O
s. O
10 O
of O
the O
Banking B-STATUTE

Act, I-STATUTE
1949, I-STATUTE
prior O
to O
its O
amendment O
in O
1956. O
The O
said O
section, O
according O
to O
that O
decision, O
prohibited O
the O
grant O
of O
industrial O
bonus O
to O
bank O
employees O
inasmuch O
as O
such O
bonus O
is O
remuneration O
which O
takes O
the O
form O
of O
a O
share O
in O
the O
profits O
of O
a O

company. O
In O
dealing O
with O
the O
character O
of O

in O

to O
remuneration O
specified O
by O
s. O
10, O
S. O
Das, O
J., O

observed O
that O
bonus O
in O
the O
industrial O
sense O
as O
understood O
in O
our O
country O
does O
come O
out O
of O
the O
available O
surplus O
gap, O
wholly O
or O
in O
the O

id O
it O
fills O
the O

2 O
to O
7 O
herein O
claiming O
to O
be O
the O
reversioners O
of O
the O
estate O
of O
one O
Raja O
Ajitsingh. O
Ajit O
Singh O
was O
the O
Raja O
of O
Saliya O
Estate O
consisting O
of O
73 O
villages O
and O
other O
property O
situate O
in O
Jabalpur O
and O
Saugor O
Districts. O
We, O
therefore, O
hold O
that O
on O
the O
death O
of O
the O
widow, O
the O
illegitimate O
son, O
the O
father O
of O
the O
first O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
herein, O
succeeded O
to O
the O
other O
half O
share O
of O
the O
estate O
of O
his O
putative O
father O
Raja O
Ajit O
Singh. O
It O
is. O
next O
contended O
that O
the O
widows O
acquired O
an O
absolute O
interest O
in O
the O
estate O
of O
Raja. O
Ajit O
Singh O
by O
adverse O
possession O
and, O
therefore, O
the O
property O
would O
devolve O
not O
on O
Raja O
Ajit O
Singhs O
heirs O
but O
on O
the O
heirs O
of O
the O
widows. O
On O
the O
question O
of O
adverse O
possession O
also, O
both O
the O
courts O
below O
have O
held O
against O
the O
appellant. O
But O
learned O
counsel O
argued O
that O
in O
the O
circumstances O
of O
this O
case O
the O
said O
find- O
ing O
was O
a O
mixed O
question O
of O
fact O
and O
law. O
It O
was O
said O
that O
the O
courts O
below O
missed O
the O
point O
that O
the O
Court O
of O
Wards, O
representing O
the O
widows, O
held O
the O
Estate O
adversely O
to O
Ramraghuraj O
Singh O
in O
respect O
of O
his O
half O
share O
and, O
therefore, O
the O
fact O
that O
during O
its O
management O
the O
widows O
did O
not O
deny O
the O
title O
of O
Ramraghuraj O
Singh O
or O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
admitted O
his O
title O
could O
not O
affect O
the O
question O
of O
adverse O
possession. O
Assuming O
that O
learned O
counsel O
for O
the O
appellant O
was O
correct O
in O
his O
contention, O
we O
fail O
to O
see O
how O
the O
said O
legal O
position O
would O
advance O
the O
appellants O
case, O
for O
the O
Court O
of O
Wards O
admittedly O
managed O
only O
the O
I.L.R. O
1938 O
Nag. O
255. O
widows O
limited O
estate O
and O
it O
is O
not O
the O
case O
of O
the O
appellant O
that O
the O
Court O
of O
Wards O
acquired O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
widows O
an O
absolute O
interest O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
half O
share O
of O
Ramraghuraj O
Singh O
in O
the O
suit O
properties. O
The O
plaintiffs O
themselves O
claimed O
to O
hereversioners O
of O
Raja O
Ajit O
Singh O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
the O
succession O
to O
him O
opened O
out O
when O
the O
widows O
died O
and O
if O
their O
contention O
be O
accepted, O
namely, O
that O
the O
widows O
acquired O
an O
absolute O
interest O
in O
half O
of O
the O
property, O
they O
would O
be O
non-suited O
in O
respect O
thereof O
on O
the O
simple O
ground O
that O
their O
suit O
was O
not O
to O
recover O
the O
property O
as O
the O
heirs O
of O
the O
widows. O
But, O
as O
we O
have O
pointed O
out, O
the O
widows O
would O
have O
acquired O
a O
title O
by O
adverse O
possession O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
share O
of O
Ramraghuraj O
Singh O
only O
in O
their O
capacity O
as O
owners O
of O
a O
limited O
estate O
i.e., O
in O
regard O
to O
their O
half O
share O
they O
held O
it O
as O
widows O
estate O
and O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
other O
half-share O
of O
Ramraghuraj O
Singh O
they O
acquired O
a O
right O
by O
adverse O
possession O
only O
a O
limited O
estate O
therein. O

He O
seems O
to O
have O
had O
the O
whip O
hand. O
Instead O
of O
doing O
that O
he O
entered O
into O
an O
arrangement O
which, O
while O
giving O
him O
the O
necessary O
facili- O
ties, O
appears O
to O
have O
satisfied O
the O
company O
by O
allowing O
it O
to O
retain O
its O
investments O
without O
a O
precipitate O
liquidation O
of O
a O
large O
portion O
thereof. O
It O
does O
not O
matter O
whether O
the O
company O
was O
right O
in O
this O
view O
or O
wrong, O
and O
in O
any O
event O
we O
are O
in O
no O
position O
to O
judge O
of O
the O
soundness O
of O
its O
decision O
because O
we O
have O
not O
all O
the O
materials O
before O
us. O
It O
has O
to O
be O
remembered O
that O
considerations O
of O
this O
kind O
go O
deeper O
than O
the O
apparent O
profit O
or O
loss O
on O
an O
isolated O
transaction O
standing O
by O
itself. O
It O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
say O
that O
the O
50,000 O
shares O
which O
were O
cancelled O
earned O
in O
the O
following O
year O
only O
31/2 O
per O
cent. O
interest O
as O
against O
5 O
per O
cent. O
on O
the O
debentures O
because O
we O
do O
not O
know O
to O
what O
extent O
the O
hold- O
ings O
of O
the O
company O
would O
have O
been O
disturbed O
if O
this O
had O
not O
been O
done. O
What O
we O
do O
know O
is O
what O
the O
Income-tax O
Appel- O
late O
Tribunal O
has O
stated, O
namely, O
that-- O
the O
change O
brought O
about O
had O
been O
so O
designed O
that O
the O
investments O
of O
the O
company O
were O
not O
to O
be O
disturbed O
and O
as O
a O
consequence O
the O
income O
accrued O
was O
in O
no O
way O
to O
be O
affected. O
This O
has O
only O
to O
be O
stated O
to O
show O
the O
commercial O
nature O
of O
the O
transaction O
from O
the O
companys O
point O
of O
view. O
The O
High O
Court O
considered O
that O
the O
capital O
of O
the O
compa- O
ny O
could O
have O
been O
reduced O
in O
other O
ways. O
But O
that O
again O
is O
not O
the O
point. O
There O
are O
usually O
many O
ways O
in O
which O
a O
given O
thing O
can O
be O
brought O
about O
in O
business O
circles O
but O
it O
is O
not O
for O
the O
Court O
to O
decide O
which O
of O
them O
should O
have O
been O
employed O
when O
the O
Court O
is O
deciding O
a O
question O
under O
section B-PROVISION
12(2) O
of O
the O
Income-tax O
Act. O
It O
was O
argued O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
respondent B-RESPONDENT
(basing O
the O
same O
on O
paragraph O
7 O
of O
the O
appellants O
application O
to O
the O
High O
Court O
dated O
5th B-DATE
April, I-DATE
1947) O
that O
the O
company O
had O
at O
the O
time O
sufficient O
liquid O
resources O
to O
effect O
the O
reduction O
of O
capital O
desired O
and O
so O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
resort O
to O
this O
process. O
But O
that O
again O
is O
not O
the O
point. O
The O
company O
chose O
to O
do O
it O
this O
way, O
and O
as O
there O
was O
not O
even O
a O
sugges- O
tion O
of O
fraud, O
the O
only O
question O
is O
whether O
it O
was O
gone O
through O
as O
an O
ordinary O
commercial O
proposition. O
But O
we O
doubt O
if O
that O
is O
what O
paragraph O
7 O
meant O
because O
in O
paragraph O
4 O
of O
the O
application O
to O
the O
High O
Court O
dated O
11th B-DATE
February, I-DATE
1944, O
the O
petitioner B-PETITIONER
stated O
that O
the O
money O
on O
hand O
and O
at O
short O
notice O
was O
only O
Rs. O
8,94,379. O
That O
is O
a O
good O
deal O
short O
of O
50 O
lacs. O
However, O
we O
need O
not O
enter O
into O
this O
in O
detail. O
On O
a O
full O
review O
of O
the O
facts O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
this O
transaction O
was O
voluntarily O
entered O
into O
in O
order O
indirectly O
to O
facilitate O
the O
carrying O
on O
of O
the O
business O
of O
the O
company O
and O
was O
made O
on O
the O
ground O
of O
commercial O
expediency. O
It O
therefore O
falls O
within O
the O
purview O
of O
section B-PROVISION
12(2) O
of O
the O
Income-tax O
Act, O
1922 O
before O
its O
amendment O
in O
1939. O
This O
being O
an O
investment O
company, O
if O
it O
borrowed O
money O
and O
utilised O
the O
same O
for O
its O
investments O
on O
which O
it O
earned O
income, O
the O
interest O
paid O
by O
it O
on O
the O
loans O
will O
clearly O
be O
a O
permissible O
deduction O
under O
section B-PROVISION
12(2) O
of O
the O
Income- O
tax O
Act. O
Whether O
the O
loan O
is O
taken O
on O
an O
overdraft, O
or O
is O
a O
fixed O
deposit O
or O
on O
a O
debenture O
makes O
no O
difference O
in O
law. O
The O
only O
argument O
urged O
against O
allowing O
this O
deduction O
to O
be O
made O
is O
that O
the O
person O
who O
took O
the O
debentures O
was O
the O
party O
who O
sold O
the O
ordinary O
shares. O
It O
cannot O
be O
disputed O
that O
if O
the O
debentures O
were O
held O
by O
a O
third O
party, O
the O
interest O
payable O
on O
the O
same O
would O
be O
an O
allowable O
deduction O
in O
calculating O
the O
total O
income O
of O
the O
assessee O
company. O
What O
difference O
does O
it O
make O
if O
the O
holder O
of O
the O
debentures O
is O
a O
shareholder O
? O

leave O
to O
inspect O
the O
court O
records O
and O
proceedings O
of O
the O
application O
and O
to O
take O
copies O
thereof. O
The O
appellant O
contended O
that O
the O
order O
made O
by O
Mr. B-OTHER_PERSON
Justice I-OTHER_PERSON
Mitter I-OTHER_PERSON
on O
January O
18, O
1960, O
was O
obtained O
by O
suppression O
of O
material O
facts O
and O
that, O
in O
any O
event, O
the O
order O
made O
without O
notice O
to O
the O
appellant O
was O
vexatious O
and O
oppressive O
and O
amounted O
to O
an O
abuse O
of O
the O
process O
of O
Court. O
Manifestly, O
the O
order O
could O
be O
obtained O
on O
a O
petition O
which O
was O
required O
to O
be O
verified O
by O
the O
official O
liquidator O
and O
there O
had O
to O
be O
a O
formal O
hearing O
and O
only O
if O
a O
prima O
facie O
case O
for O
hearing O
had O
been O
made O
out O
the O
order O
could O
be O
made. O
Under O
the O
Companies O
(Court) O
Rules O
a O
different O
practice, O
which O
approaches O
the O
practice O
prevailing O
in O
the O
English O
Courts O
has O
been O
set O
up. O
The O
mere O
fact O
that O
under O
r. O
195 O
of O
the O
Calcutta B-STATUTE
High I-STATUTE
Court I-STATUTE
Rules I-STATUTE
under O
Act O
of O
1913 O
the O
appellant O
might O
have O
had O
a O
right O
of O
access O
to O
the O
statement O
on O
which O
the O
order O
was O
founded O
will O
not O
be O
an O
adequate O
ground O
for O
holding O
that O
the O
earlier O
practice O
must O
continue O
to O
prevail. O
If O
the O
appellant O
is O
not O
entitled O
to O
inspection O
of O
the O
statement O
he O
would O
certainly, O
for O
the O
same O
reason, O
not O
be O
entitled O
to O
a O
copy O
of O
that O
statement. O

This O
appeal O
by O
special O
leave O
is O
against O
the O
order O
of O
the O
High O
Court O
at O
Allahabad O
under O
s. O
133 O
of O
the O
Code O
of O
Criminal O
Procedure. O
The O
three O
appellants O
carry O
on O
the O
trade O
of O
auctioning O
vegetables. O
These O
vegetables, O
it O
appears, O
are O
brought O
in O
carts O
which O
are O
parked O
on O
the O
public O
road O
outside O
the O
building O
where O
the O
auctioning O
takes O
place. O
There O
was O
some O
dispute O
between O
these O
appellants O
and O
the O
Municipal O
Board O
which O
it O
is O
suggested O
by O
the O
appellants O
was O
really O
behind O
the O
move O
to O
get O
this O
order O
under O
s. O
133 O
passed O
against O
them. O
It O
is O
unnecessary, O
however, O
for O
us O
to O
consider O
that O
matter. O
What O
appears O
to O
be O
clear O
is O
that O
the O
trade O
is O
carried O
on O
in O
a O
private O
house O
in O
the O
subzimandi O
quarter O
and O
it O
does O
happen O
that O
some O
amount O
of O
inconvenience O
is O
caused O
to O
people O
who O
pass O
by O
the O
public O
road O
because O
of O
the O
carts O
which O
necessarily O
come O
near O
this O
house. O
The O
real O
question O
is, O
whether O
because O
this O
trade O
of O
auctioning O
vegetables O
which O
the O
appellants O
carry O
on O
in O
their O
private O
house O
produce O
the O
consequence O
that O
people O
passing O
by O
the O
road O
are O
put O
to O
inconvenience, O
action O
can O
be O
taken O
under O
s. O
133 O
of O
the O
Code O
of O
Criminal O
Procedure. O
The O
High O
Court O
seems O
to O
be O
of O
the O
opinion O
- O
when O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
business O
of O
auctioning O
vegetables O
cannot O
be O
carried O
on O
without O
causing O
obstruction O
to O
the O
passers O
by, O
the O
conduct O
of O
the O
business O
can O
be O
prohibited, O
even O
though O
it O
is O
carried O
on O
in O
a O
private O
place. O
It O
seems O
to O
us O
that O
this O
proposition O
has O
been O
put O
too O
widely. O
Section O
133 O
of O
the O
Code O
of O
Criminal O
Procedure O
empowers O
action O
by O
the O
District O
Magistrate, O
Sub-Divisional O
Magistrate O
of O
Magistrate O
1st O
class O
to O
remove O
public O
nuisances O
in O
certain O
circumstances. O
Undoubtedly, O
some O
amount O
of O
noise O
the O
auction O
is O
going O
on. O
That O
however O
is O
a O
necessary O
concomitant O
of O
buying O
and O
selling O
large O
quantities O
and O
it O
will O
be O
unreasonable O
to O
think O
that O
merely O
because O
some O
amount O
of O
noise O
is O
caused O
which O
people O
preferring O
perfect O
peace O
may O
not O
like, O
this O
is O
injurious O
to O
the O
physical O
comfort, O
or O
health O
of O
the O
community. O
It O
appears O
to O
us O
that O
the O
conduct O
of O
trades O
of O
this O
nature O
and O
indeed O
of O
other O
trades O
in O
localities O
of O
a O
city O
where O
such O
trades O
are O
usually O
carried O
on, O
is O
bound O
to O
produce O
some O
discomfort, O
though O
at O
the O
same O
time O
resulting O
perhaps O
in O
the O
good O
of O
the O
community O
in O
other O
respects. O
If O
a O
trade O
like O
auctioning O
which O
has O
to O
be O
carried O
on O
as O
necessary O
for O
the O
well O
being O
of O
the O
community, O
some O
amount O
of O
noise O
has O
to O
be O
borne O
in O
at O
least O
that O
part O
of O
the O
town O
where O
such O
trade O
is O
ordinarily O
carried O
on. O
In O
making O
the O
provisions O
of O
s. O
133 O
of O
the O
Code O
of O
Criminal O
Procedure, O
the O
legislature O
cannot O
have O
intended O
the O
stoppage O
of O
such O
trades O
in O
such O
part O
of O
the O
town, O
merely O
because O
of O
the O
discomfort O
caused O
by O
the O
noise O
in O
carrying O
on O
the O
trade. O
In O
our O
opinion O
therefore, O
the O
slight O
discomfort O
that O
may O
be O
caused O
to O
some O
people O
passing O
by O
the O
road O
or O
living O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
cannot O
ordinarily O
be O
considered O
to O
be O
such O
as O
to O
justify O
action O
under O
s. O
133 O
of O
the O
Code O
of O
Criminal O
Procedure. O
We O
do O
not O
think O
that O
the O
orders O
are O
justified O
under O
s. O
133. O
